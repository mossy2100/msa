<h2>Analogue Rover Project</h2>  

<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">

Project Marsupial has entered a new era with 
the purchase of a new Forward Control Landrover
which will serve as the basis for a Mars 
analogue rover. The new vehicle will be called
simply the "Marsupial rover" and will supercede
the Mitsubishi L300-based "HOP".<P>
 
The FC Landrover has a distinguished history
as a rugged 4WD military truck, emergency 
ambulance, expedition and safari transport.
The purchased vehicle is a Series IIA, similar
to the one in the photo. It is licenced, but
will require some repair work before being ready
to drive. The Project Marsupial team expects to
commence that work in March. We intend the 
Marsupial rover to be driveable on public roads,
since this will greatly enhance its useability.<P>
 
Though the project has funds, more funding will 
be required to sucessfully complete the overall 
project to MSA standards. For this reason, we 
have decided to separate the project into stages,
with each stage being commenced only when enough 
money has been raised to complete it. <P>
 
Stage 1, already begun, concerns the purchase of a
suitable vehicle chassis, and its refit and 
modification for use as the Marsupial rover. <P>
 
Stage 2 will be the design and construction of a
plastic body to make the machine into an eyecatching,
yet functional Mars rover. It is important that the
vehicle look like part of a future mission to Mars,
because of the media attention it is certain to 
attract. Yet it must serve our needs as a test bed
for trying out exploration strategies, equipment
tests and plausible surface operation scenarios 
during Operation Red Centre.<P>
 
Stage 3, accordingly, will complete an interior
fitout of the vehicle. This will involved the 
purchase and installation of interior lighting,
communications station, storage cabinets, bunks,
spacesuit lockers, sink and toilet facilities. 
In effect, the vehicle will turned into a self-
contained camper, ready for travel across the
simulated Martian landscape.<P>
 
Stay tuned for details of planned Marsupial
rover scenarios during Operation Red Centre.<P>
