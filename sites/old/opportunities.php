Mars Society Australia is planning on expanding links with Australian universities through proposing a range of project suitable for honours students. MSA would mentor students doing these projects and provide background knowledge about the sites. Where possible and relevant, MSA members would accompany the students in the field. In exchange for this the student and institution would acknowledge MSA support and the student would join MSA for a minimum of the year. They would also be expected to present their results at a subsequent Australian Mars Exploration Conference.  <br><br>
