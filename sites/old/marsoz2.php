New MarsOz Base Report - December 2004
</span>
<br>
<br>

<span class="bodytext">
This report is based on a paper to be submitted to the Journal of the
British Interplanetary Society, so has not yet been publically released.  
It consists of a feasibility study of whether
modules the size and shape of those designed for the MARS-OZ simulated base
are compatible with the technical requirements of an actual Mars mission.
The report examines mass budgets, power loading and propellant requirements
through the main phases of the mission from Earth orbit departure to Mars
surface departure.  It shows that modules with the same overall configuration
and dimensions as those proposed for the MARS-OZ simulated base are
compatible with a Mars Semi-Direct mission architecture and a four person
crew, using ISPP for the Mars ascent phase of the mission for essentially the
same earth-departure per module as Mars Direct.  The report also concludes
that a horizontally landed module is a superior configuration to the
vertically landed modules of most other mission scenarios from the
perspective of surface operations.

Project Update - January 2004
</span>
<br>
<br>

<span class="bodytext">
The Mars Oz project has passed a major milestone in December 2003 with the
completion of the structural design and the conceptual interior layout by David
Willson, a Hobart-based structural engineer with MSA.  Mars-Oz consists of two
modules, one housing the living and laboratory spaces, the other a garage for
Marsupial and workshop, joined by an adaptor that will allow docking of the
Starchaser Marsupial rover and simulated pedestrian EVAs, as required.  The
Mars-Oz modules have detachable wheels, allowing them to be towed to their
designed location with a minimum of work.  The cargo module detached into two,
one being the garage and workshop, the other and fuel storage module.  The
basic structures have gone out for tender and responses are expected by early
February.
<br>
<br>

The configuartion of Mars-Oz is based on a horizontally-landed bent biconic
aeroshell, one concept that has been considered for mars lander designs.  This
shape is different from that chosen for other Maras analogue research stations
and allows the evaluation ofarchitectural and human factors implications of a
configuration different to the more common vertical cylinder.  The mission
profile of such a spacecraft is consistent with proposals such as the NASA
Design Reference Mission and Mars Direct.
<br>
<br>

The next stage of the Mars-Oz design process is to integrate the power,
air-conditioning, ventilation, waste disposal and water recycling systems with
the structure and provide an comfortable, realistic interior that can be
readily reconfigured to test different layouts.  This phase is being led by the
expertise of two leading Melbourne architects, David Oppenhiem of SBE and
Kirsten Thompson of Kirsten Thompson Associates.  MSA is very pleased to have
such distinguished people contribute their time and expertise to the Mars-Oz
project.
<br>
<br>

The Mars-Oz complex will provide the centre piece of Mars analogue research in
Australia, a focus for education and outreach, and be a testbed and
demonstrator of concepts in autonomous, low impact architecture concepts.  MSA
selected the Arkaroola region as the prime Mars analogue research area during
the Jartimarra-1 expedition of 2001. Selection of the precise site for the
modules at Arkaroola will be carried out in August 2004 as part of a larger
expedition to the area by MSA and international collaborators.

MarsOz Proposal Document

Mars Society Australia has released version 1 of the Australian Mars Analogue Research Station
 (MarsOz) proposal document.  Click <A href="/library/MARSOZ_Proposal-ver1A.pdf">here</a> to download the document in pdf format (1.3mb). <P>

The Lake Frome Plains to the east of Arkaroola was selected for the site of (MARS-OZ) during the <A HREF="/jnt/diaries.shtml#introduction">Jarntimarra Expedition</A>, undertaken in
October-November 2001.  MarsOz will provide a laboratory to study how humans will live 
and work on Mars, and will complement similar stations in  
<A href="http://desert.marssociety.org/" target=_top>Utah</A>, 
<A href="http://arctic.marssociety.org/" target=_top>Devon Island</A>, 
and Iceland.  
<br>
<br>

This document describes the <A HREF="site_selection.shtml">selection process</A> by which six regions, 200 km 
in diameter, were identified as potential sites and Arkaroola chosen as the preferred
 location for MarsOz.  The Arkaroola region offers a wide range of terrain types, 
has a complex geology, is relatively easy to access logistically, has outreach 
opportunities, and includes a number of localities previously studied as Mars analogues.  
<br>
<br>

The document reviews how and why MSA has chosen a different configuration for 
the MarsOz habitat to the “tuna can” chosen for the other localities.  Our preferred 
sketch simulates a horizontally landed biconic.  Using a different configuration 
allows comparisons between different lander designs to be evaluated. Horizontally landed biconics  
have some advantages in an actual Mars mission over other configurations in terms of mission 
profile and surface operations.  Furthermore, we believe this long thin horizontal configuration 
has considerable logistic advantages over the tuna can design.
<br>
<br>

The habitat itself is part of a larger complex which will eventually include a simulated cargo 
lander, also of biconic design, inflatable structures and solar power systems.  All operations
 will be carried out in conjunction with existing analogue research programs including the 
<A href="/marsupial/index.php">Starchaser Marsupial</A> Rover with its unique utility configuration, 
and <A href="/marsskin.php">MarsSkin</a> analogue mechanical counter 
pressure (MCP) space suits.
<br>
<br>

These components together comprise a significantly different vision for an analogue 
research station to those constructed or proposed to date.  Together, they are shown
 in the above illustration by 
<script> email('jo','graphicssolutions.iinet.net.au','Jozef Michalek')</script>.
 Potential research at the facility is multi-disciplinary.
  This document highlights engineering, science, information systems, environmental systems, 
and human factors as the key fields of research.
<br>
<br>

Finally, this document outlines further work necessary to transform the sketch into a detailed design
 proposal and possible costs of doing so.  The only available costing is comparison with other Mars 
Analogue Research Stations.  These comparisons, converted to Australian dollars, suggest a construction
 cost of the order of $700,000 and an annual operating cost of $120,000.  We envisage the facility operating
 for a preliminary period of five years. A series of 8 program way points provide a guide to significant landmarks
 in the achievement of the goal of an operating MarsOz. They are the decision to commit to MARS-OZ, 
region selection, preliminary design, formal design, site selection, construction, deployment, and operation.  
This document marks the conclusion of the preliminary design phase.
