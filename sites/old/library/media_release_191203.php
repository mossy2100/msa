The European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft is about to say
farewell to the Beagle 2 lander on 19 December, as the latter is
released and heads off to the surface of Mars. Once separated from
Mars Express, Beagle 2 becomes a spacecraft in its own right for the
last five days of its momentous journey to study some of the mysteries
of the Red Planet.<p>

The ESA's Mars Express was launched from Earth on 2 June 2003, after a
six-month cruise at an average speed of about 10 kilometres per second
and covering a distance of about 400 million kilometres. After a very
complicated and challenging series of operations during the night of
24/25 December 2003, the probe will be injected into an elliptical
orbit near the poles of the Red Planet, while the Beagle 2 lander -
released from the mother craft six days earlier - is expected to
touchdown on the surface of Mars.<p>

On 19 December, ESA's ground control team at Darmstadt (Germany) will
send the command for the Beagle 2 lander to separate from Mars
Express. A pyrotechnic device will be fired to slowly release a loaded
spring, which will gently push Beagle 2 away from the mother
spacecraft.<p>

Data on the spacecraft's position and speed will be used by mission
engineers to assess whether the lander was successfully released. In
addition, the onboard Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) should provide an
image showing the lander slowly moving away towards the Martian
surface.<p>

Beagle 2 will operate on the surface for about six Earth months,
relaying data back to Earth via Mars Express. The Beagle 2 lander will
incorporate a number of instruments to aid research into Mars and the
chances of finding life on this frozen desert, including ASPERA
(Energetic Neutral Atoms Analyser) to study how the solar wind
interacts with the Martian atmosphere, and discover how water vapour
and other gases could have escaped from Mars in the past, and HRSC
(High/Super Resolution Stereo Colour Imager), a stereoscopic camera
that will photograph the Martian surface, revealing details as small
as 2 metres. Other instruments will measure temperature, pressure and
variations in gravity in the atmosphere, map the distribution of water
and ice in the upper sub-surface, determine the mineral content of the
surface and molecular content of the atmosphere, and study the
composition of the Martian atmosphere.<p>

According to Guy Murphy, President of Mars Society Australia, a
non-profit organization dedicated to raising public awareness of the
importance of sending humans to Mars, the rover missions represent &quot;an
exciting new phase of exploration.  If the Beagle lander finds
evidence of life on Mars, past or present, however slim, there will be
a great deal of pressure to send people to Mars to further
investigate. This mission could therefore be an important precursor to
a human presence on Mars.&quot;<p>

Beagle 2 isn't the only lander heading towards the surface of Mars at
the moment. NASA has sent two Mars Exploration Rover robots on their
way to Mars, with both scheduled to arrive in January.<p>

Once Beagle 2 lands on Mars, the outer casing will be opened and the
solar panels unfold, charging the batteries that power the
lander. Then a robotic arm will start to operate, with most of the
experiments attached to its end. These include a corer/grinder and
mole, which will be used to collect rock and soil samples for
analysis. The mole will be able to crawl up to several metres on the
surface, but its pace is slow, at just 1 cm every six seconds. It can
burrow underground to collect samples up to 1.5 metres below the
surface. Ovens on the Beagle 2 can heat these samples in the presence
of oxygen, to look for signs of past or present life.<p>
