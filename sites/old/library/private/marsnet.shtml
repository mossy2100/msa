      Analogue Research Satellite Network<BR></FONT><FONT 
      face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2><I>A proposal by 
      Mars Society Australia</I></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>The next 
      great step taken by humans will be upon the planet Mars.&nbsp; During 
      Soviet and American preparations for the journey to the Moon, extensive 
      use was made of earth “analogue environments”, places on our home planet 
      where we could better understand the challenges that awaited us on another 
      world.&nbsp; Space flight remains a difficult business and the attention 
      of Mars mission researchers is increasingly turning to areas on earth that 
      individually and collectively replicate features of the Martian 
      environment or Mars missions.&nbsp; These can be reached for a tiny 
      fraction of the cost and risk, and vital lessons can be learned.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>The Mars 
      Society has initiated a major project to establish a string of Mars 
      Analogue Research Stations (herein referred to as the Mars-x Project) 
      around the world.&nbsp; The first Mars-x was established in 2000, and 
      these stations are expected to make significant contributions to planning 
      and facilitating future human missions by providing unique research 
      platforms and raising public awareness of the opportunity that lies before 
      us.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>The four 
      stations expected to make up the worldwide network will be located in 
      remote areas where communications and infrastructure are marginal at 
      best.&nbsp; It is unlikely all stations will be occupied for field 
      operations throughout the year.&nbsp; Without a system of year round 
      communications, autonomous scientific field instruments (common tools in 
      analogue field research) may have very limited usability, and the physical 
      condition of each Mars-x will be unknown.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>This 
      document therefore proposes establishment and operation of MARSNET – the 
      Mars Analogue Research Satellite Network.&nbsp; <b>This would be the first 
      microsatellite communications system devoted to analogue research 
      activities for human Mars missions.&nbsp; It would be the first 
      space-based project of the recently formed international Mars 
      Society.</b>&nbsp; It is a system designed to increase Mars Society 
      capabilities, reduce communications costs and add a new and valuable 
      dimension to human Mars mission analogue research.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>The 
      project should commence immediately and take advantage of a unique 
      opportunity to acquire the Store and Forward Communications (SAFC) payload 
      on the Joint Australian Engineering Satellite (JAESAT).&nbsp; JAESAT is 
      planned for launch from Ukraine in late 2002.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>MARSNET 
      would allow emails to be sent between Mars Society research stations, 
      mobile units (e.g. rovers), field expeditions, Mission Controllers and the 
      internet.&nbsp; MARSNET orbital components (e.g. JAESAT) would cover the 
      entire surface of the earth each day, relaying messages between ground 
      stations and allowing communication amongst operations and expedition 
      crews and automated monitoring and control of analogue systems.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>It would 
      consist of three segments; space, ground and software, which could be 
      developed by three Mars Society teams on three continents.&nbsp; The space 
      segment would consist of the JAESAT orbital component and others secured 
      by Mars Society members.&nbsp; The ground segment would consist of mobile 
      terminals for communicating with these orbital components, integrated with 
      site Local Area Networks (LANs) and the internet.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>The 
      software segment would consist primarily of a highly functional Mars 
      Society Mission Control (MSMC) website, terminal software as well as 
      various autonomous system communications protocols.&nbsp; The scope of the 
      software segment would extent beyond SAFC to the integration of Command, 
      Control and Communications (C3) for all analogue activities into a single, 
      user friendly interface accessible from anywhere in the world via the 
      internet.</FONT></P><FONT 
      face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>Working closely 
      with the Mars-x project, MARSNET would add impetus and strengthen the 
      international nature of Mars Society activities.&nbsp; The project would 
      be overseen by an international committee and, according to this proposal, 
      would raise 50% of its own funding requirements.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>The Mars 
      Society needs:</FONT></P>

        seek ways to continually improve the fidelity of Mars analogue research 
        activities.</FONT> </LI></OL>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>Not only 
      would MARSNET become a useful support service, it would also become a 
      valuable research tool in its own right.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>Firstly, 
      the finite speed of light results in a delay of between 3 and 22 minutes 
      for communication transmissions between earth and Mars over the course of 
      an earth year.&nbsp; Responses to questions between flight and ground 
      crews during human Mars missions could take at least 45 minutes.&nbsp; 
      Normally a routine inconvenience, yet an extremely long time in any 
      emergency situation.&nbsp; Crews will need to be far more autonomous than 
      was the case with the lunar landings.&nbsp; Thus one feature of the 
      MARSNET system (uncontrollable but predictable message delays) that might 
      be considered a disadvantage could in fact be turned into an added 
      benefit.&nbsp; It would help us better understand crew productivity and 
      autonomy issues for Mars mission command and control scenarios.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular 
      size=2>Secondly, it is highly likely human Mars missions will be preceded 
      and supported by a powerful communications relay satellite system, 
      probably in Mars geostationary orbit.&nbsp; However, there will be a role 
      for Low Mars Orbiting (LMO) microsatellites for precisely the same reasons 
      that LEO microsatellites are useful on earth – they provide cost effective 
      low-power communications requiring only small, mobile, non-tracking ground 
      terminals for low-level needs.&nbsp; They’re more appropriate for certain 
      tasks, such as automated data acquisition and control of remote science 
      stations or exploration robots.&nbsp;&nbsp; They’d also provide a cheap 
      and robust backup system for surface-surface crew messaging.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>During 
      Mars-x operational campaigns, communications will be essential 
      for:</FONT></P>

      face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>Mars Society 
      field operations are unlikely to be confined to permanent Mars-x 
      stations.&nbsp; Expeditions into remote areas serviced by existing 
      research infrastructure (e.g. Canadian Polar Islands or Antarctic Bases) 
      are a first step, but the programme must look also to areas of scientific 
      value that have fewer support facilities.&nbsp; These mobile field 
      expeditions will be highly dependent on communications services.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>A 
      year-round communications system assuring low-level services such as 
      telemetry and packet messaging to and from anywhere in the world is 
      necessary.&nbsp; The digital Store and Forward Communications (SAFC) class 
      of low earth orbiting microsatellites ideally suits this duty.&nbsp; These 
      have evolved since the launch of UoSat-2 in 1984 into a relatively 
      standard and highly cost-effective remote data system.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>MARSNET, 
      or the Mars Analogue Research Satellite Network would consist of one to 
      three dedicated SAFC microsatellites in different high inclination orbits 
      (preferably sun-synchronous, see section 4.3), together with 3-9 digital 
      packet radio ground terminals for distribution around the world, with 1-3 
      of these acting as semi-permanent ground station gateways connected to a 
      broadband internet link.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>The SAFC 
      payloads would be secured on existing or proposed satellites for minimal 
      cost.&nbsp; The acquisition or development of two types of ground 
      terminals would be required, one for fixed Mars-x class stations connected 
      to a LAN, and one for man-portable small field 
      expeditions.</FONT></P><FONT 
      face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>MARSNET would 
      provide the ability for Mars Society personnel and members to deliver 
      useful email messages to each other regardless of where they are, 
      year-round, in a predictable manner.&nbsp; These would include text, 
      digital multimedia (or other binary) files, data and remote station 
      control instructions.&nbsp; This would not replace other broadband and 
      real-time services, but would reduce dependence on third party providers 
      and enhance analogue research capabilities.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>A 
      technical description of the system, with diagrams and analysis can be 
      found in the section 4 of the OCD.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular 
      size=2><B>BUDGET ESTIMATE</B> (all figures US$, time value of money 
      ignored)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>Total 
      project cost over 5 years is estimated at $100,000.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular 
      size=2>The costs would be shared between four groups, with the work 
      undertaken primarily by three of these groups.&nbsp; The main contribution 
      of the Mars Society (US) from existing funds would be&nbsp; $17,000 in 
      2001 and $17,000 in 2002 ( the total over five years being $36,000).&nbsp; 
      This would help secure JAESAT and an extra satellite SAFC payload, provide 
      terminal development seed funding for the Ground Segment team, would 
      furnish the US Mars Society with 2-3 ground terminals and would facilitate 
      one project management meeting in each of 2001 and 2002 outside the annual 
      Mars Society convention.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular size=2>The 
      three project teams would raise the rest of the required total, around 
      $65,000 through new sponsorship and donations.&nbsp; It is suggested the 
      "Group B" in the budget document could be Mars Society Europe, while Group 
      C could be a US or Canadian group.</FONT></P>
