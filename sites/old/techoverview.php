Mars is within reach.&nbsp; The fourth planet from the sun, the Red Planet, is the
next great measure of our mettle.&nbsp; Mars is a potential new world for
humanity.  It has all the stuff needed to sustain a substantial human
presence. It has water, an atmosphere, mineral wealth. Simply
exploring the surface of another world will teach us a great deal about our
present one.&nbsp; And Mars is no longer just a distant dream.&nbsp; In the last
decade, major strides toward feasible, affordable human missions were made.
Sending humans to Mars is now the formal goal of NASA and the European Space Agency.  
The question is no longer, �Can we go?� but, �When will we go?�
<br>
<br>

The journey begins here, on the oldest continent, where we undertake comparative research
and test surface exploration strategies and technologies in renowned Mars
analogue locations. Our vision is to position Australia for a role in
establishing a human presence on Mars.
<br>
<br> 

One of the ways Mars Society Australia pursues this vision is by undertaking its own research projects, 
usefully contributing to the large body of knowledge that a human Mars mission will need to draw upon.  Summaries of 
some of our major projects are given below.  You can also view a full <A href="/bibliography.php">bibliography<A>

      <span class="bodytext">The international <b>Mars Society</b> has established 
      research stations on arctic Devon Island and in the desert of southern Utah. 
      The facilities are designed to be �flight-like�, similar to the
      kind of planetary entry, descent and landing habitats used in leading
      humans-to-Mars mission proposals. These allow realistic simulations to help test mission planning hypotheses. 
		Three additional stations around the world will be built, including
      <b>the Mars Australian Research Station</b> <A href="/marsoz.php"target=main>(Mars-Oz)</a>.
      <A href="/marsoz.php"target=main>MarsOz</a> will allow local and international researchers to help
      answer critical questions related to human Mars missions and will raise
      awareness of the opportunities awaiting at the Red Planet.

      <span class="bodytext"> <b>"Human factors�</b> has been an important consideration in US, Russian and other space programmes to date.  
Particular issues have included the impact of microgravity on human biological systems, design of living 
quarters, and group interaction in confined spaces.  These issues are even more important when considering 
the long duration space flight, communication lags and hostile environment to be faced by explorers on Mars.  <P>

A number of areas of human factors research are currently under consideration by MSA.  These include 
testing habitat design, crew interaction and crew selection on the proposed <A href="/marsoz.php">Mars-OZ</a> site at Arkaroola.  
Also under consideration are techniques for measuring human performance variables such as attention, 
fatigue and �situation awareness�.   Some proposed research focuses on human-machine interaction.<P>
