<h2>TUESDAY 30 OCTOBER 2001, 20.00 hours</h2>

Location: Henbury Craters<br>

Written by: Jennifer Laing<p>

First night camping in the `bush' and we have the luxury of an extra
hour as the Northern Territory does not have daylight saving. We have
a three hour drive, and must meet up with media crews in Alice
Springs. Time for a shower at a local caravan park, and then on to the
rendezvous point - the Blue Grass restaurant. It's shut, and Nick
McCallum from Channel 9's Today Show suggests we adjourn to Bojangles
in Todd Street. Other media turn up - the Centralian Advocate
newspaper and ABC TV Alice Springs - while Vic Gostin does a radio
interview with ABC Darwin and Jon Clarke handles the ABC Alice
Springs. Lunch is rushed, and we make arrangements to meet up with the
TV crews at the turnoff to Henbury Craters from the Stuart
Highway. Channel 9 hire a chopper, and film the convoy going down the
road, from an incredibly low height. Good fun, and James W makes
everyone laugh with his aside over the vehicle intercom - `Hi Mum!'<p>

Henbury Crater was formed by a meteorite, which probably hit a couple
of thousand years ago.  A group scale the rim, while others conduct
interviews at the base.  The support party set up camp nearby, and
Channel 9 film us sitting around the campfire. After-dinner chat
centres on a movie of a Mars aeroplane which Larry Lemke helped
develop at NASA Ames Research Center. It held a group of us
spell-bound, with the young engineers such as Michael taking the
opportunity to quiz Larry on his ground-breaking
research.<p>

High-tech, juxtaposed with an Outback setting which has remained untouched for years.
