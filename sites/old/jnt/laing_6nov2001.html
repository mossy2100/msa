<h2>TUESDAY 6 NOVEMBER 2001, 19.00 hours</h2>

Location: Arkaroola<br>

Written by: Jennifer Laing<p>

The last three members of the group join us today - Malcolm Walter, Matilda Thomas and Jason Hoogland. Michael and Larry volunteer to accompany Doug Sprigg (Arkaroola resort owner) in picking them up in a small plane at Broken Hill. Apparently they both have a go at the controls and are very chuffed. Michael can't stop smiling when he returns. Others spend the morning catching up with washing, updating the database, labelling photos and exploring the area.<P>

Guy, James W, James L and Jen climb up a local hill (steepish) and get to the top, after a few false attempts by some members of the group who are less agile than the rest (OK, I was one of them, but hey I MADE IT). Pose for a timed photo on top, and then James L starts an avalanche for the hell of it. You had to be there. Finished up in the resort swimming pool which was conveniently situated outside the rooms.<P>

Melbourne Cup Day, so we crack open the champagne at dinner. Forgot to do the sweep, but just as well, as I would have lost.<P>

Night meeting at a local lecture hall, with presentations by Larry and Carol about their work and life on Devon Island. Malcolm Walter will brief us tomorrow morning, before our tour of Mount Painter.<P>

Midnight swim - hey I could get used to this.<P>
