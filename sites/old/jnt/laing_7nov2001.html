Perfect day weather-wise - like a dream. The morning Mount Painter tour is spectacular. The four wheel drives take us first to Mount Gee, for a photostop. It's rough and rugged territory, ringed with mountain tops, and a wild ride. Great fun but not for those prone to motion sickness. As Bond would say, "Shaken, not stirred."<P>

Matilda demonstrates an Australian-made PIMA machine, used for analysing geological samples, and which could be a great asset on a mission to Mars.<P>

Jason interviewed by BBC Radio. Even they know about us! So much for being remote.<P>

Afternoon is taken up with presentations by Jason and Graham on the HOP vehicle, and robotic arm, while James W talks about his work on spacesuit technology using mechanical counter-pressure.<P>

Dinner is in the hall flanking our rooms, and then more discussions post-dinner. Everyone is buoyant and looking forward to getting down to the main business of the trip tomorrow - selecting the most suitable site for a Mars research facility, and creating a science/engineering plan.<P>
