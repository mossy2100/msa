<center><h1>Jarntimarra Diary - Jennifer Laing</h1></center>
<h2>SATURDAY 27 OCTOBER 2001, 10:00 hrs</h2>
Adelaide, South Australia<br>
Jennifer Laing<P>

The group gathers for a <a href="/jnt/start_group_2_lo_res.html">photo</a>
 beside two of the convoy vehicles in the
forecourt of the South Australian Museum.  This is an historically
significant place, the starting point for many scientific and exploratory
expeditions including those of John Eyre and Douglas Mawson’s legendary
trips to the Antarctic.<P>

We had breakfast in the Museum Cafe beside fascinating collections of whale
bones, followed by a briefing from Jason Hoogland, Technical Director of MSA
and field trip leader Dr Jonathan Clarke.<P>

For those of us who weren&acute;t experienced in camping in the outback,
discussions of the frequency of shower facilities and the need to avoid
stepping over objects without checking that they weren’t a snake having a
snooze, were a high priority!<P>

The rest of us were just trying to absorb getting to know each other and
sharing experiences and stories of field trips, science - and space!<P>

The convoy looks spectacular with the logos of Mars Society Australia and
the UK Starchaser organisation, our major sponsor for the expedition.
Members of the public wander over to check it out and a TV crew arrive to
interview some of the science party - NASA's Dr Carol Stoker, Dr Larry
Lemke, and Prof Vic Gostin of Adelaide University.<P>

Jon Clarke tries out the satellite phone - it works but our email access
doesn't look a goer at this stage.  We have a few backup options, including
faxing from towns we pass through.<P>

Last night's forum in Adelaide attracted a small but enthusiastic group to
hear presentations by Dr Carol Stoker, who spoke of the reasons we should
explore Mars, Dr Mark Bishop from the University of South Australia who
spoke on Martian geomorphology, and Jason Hoogland, who took us through the
MSA technical programme and the expedition.<P>

As Mark Bishop said when looking at a photo of the surface of Mars, "It's
beautiful!  Look at it!  So let's go there!"<P>
