<h2>MONDAY 5 NOVEMBER 2001, 22.00 hours</h2>

Location: Arkaroola<br>

At lunch we pose for group photos and Carol hands out NASA caps and NASA patches. Graham then hands out the official JNT-1 patch to the group. Lots of laughter and joking.<P>

Arrive late afternoon in Arkaroola, after a long hot drive through some harsh terrain. Livened up by Rex's repertoire of CDs - Best of Smokie meets The Seekers - Live!<P>

<i>I know I'll never find another you.<BR>
And I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice.<P></i>

There are some good singers on this expedition (unfortunately I'm not one of them) and Rex is a good listener. Resolve to buy him some more CDs when I return home.<P>

Quick swim and then we have a dinner in the Arkaroola restaurant. We are staying in a homestead with 10 rooms, grouped around a central hall where we can have meals and some meetings. Showers, clean towels and beds with sheets - almost feel human.<P>
