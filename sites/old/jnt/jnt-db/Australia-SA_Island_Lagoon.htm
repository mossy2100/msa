<tr>
<td WIDTH="41%">1a. The plateau level conisists of a pebble and cobble
pavement overlying a soft reddish brown sand with a little clay. The pavement
is mainly single-layer thick. These consist of sub-rounded, silicified
sandstone, conglomerate and other hard lithologies.&nbsp;
<p>1b Slope down towards the dry lake bed. (grade) consisted of scree derived
from the plateau, in places slightly gullied creating a boulder stream.
The underlying bedrock is expose d in serveral places. It consists of horizonatally-bedded
silt stones, and find sandstones. Groundwater seeps out in places and disrupts
this bedrock with a salty efflorescence. These more weathered zones have
been subjected to significant erosion.
<p>1c The lake floor, near the shoreline, consists of damp, salty sand
and silt, scoured by recent channel outflows from recent floods. Clay has
accummulated in the scours and on drying has curled and cracked. A darker
layer of sediment suggests bacterial activity.
<p>1d Sand dunes inshore from the lakes edge consist of fine and medium
quartz sands blown into an irregular topography.&nbsp;

<tr>
<td WIDTH="41%">There are at least five topographic elements: the plateau;
the slopes; the dry lake bed; the dune fields and alluvial streams. The
importance of this from a scientific viewpoint is the large range of sites
of both geological and biological interest. From the standpoint of operations
research, a complex range of environments and features within which you
can and must operate. That range of complex terrains and forms will span
the possible range of operations in a real surface mission. At the same
time, the were no negative aspects of the site, which might have compromised
suitability . In summary the site is rated high in analog value.&nbsp;</td>
