4a. Lower terrace of Hugh River. This consists of pale, reddish grey quartzite sand, vegetated by large, old, eucalypt trees. The history of this terrace may be established by examining small gullies which have cut into these layered deposits. The river banks are 3-4 metres high. <P>
4b. Central sandy river channel. The riverbed consists of moderately sorted medium quartz sand. Occasional coarse sand grains and small pebbles are seen on the surface. The sand is built up into sand bars that are progressively moving downstream. <P>
4c Cemented gravels. Cemented gravels are visible on the eroded eastern bank of the Hugh river. An outcrop of pebble and cobble comglomerate made up of various sandstone lithologies have been cemented by calcite cement that filled empty pore space. This openwork congolmerate indicates very high velocity flow in the river. This outcrop is 150cm high, the upper 50cm of which was distinctly layered and contained a sandy matrix indicating reducing currrent flow. Downstream, the conglomerates were locally crossbedded.<P> 
4d. Sand dunes. This site is at the tail of a longitudinal dune, eroded portions of which display steep cross-bedding of fine to medium well sorted orange quartz sand. On climbing a sligher sand dune to the east, the grain size decresaed to fine, well sorted, intensely orange sand, rippled on the surface. Tracks and trails of various animals and birds could be seen. The general direction of movement has been from south to north. <P>

Vegetation is dominated by saltbush (<i>Altriplex spp.</i>), with kerosene grass, blackheads, bindyi and samphire. The larger creeks have groves of river red gum (<i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i>), coolabah (<i>Eucalyptus microtheca</i>) and gidgee (<i>Acacia cambagei</i>).

    <td width="41%">The geology is of great interest, although well studied. The
      craters will serve as excellent analogues for small craters on Mars. The
      crater walls, sparse vegetation, dry creeks, and rolling plains are
      potentially a good Marsupial testing surface. The sparse vegetation over
      much of the area makes this a good visual analogue for Mars. Provided
      access is possible the area is rated good.</td>
