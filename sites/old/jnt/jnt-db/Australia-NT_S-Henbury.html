Mosquitos and large insects are abundant. Black ants were a great nuiscance at the rotunda campsite. The bottom of some of the craters are quite boggy. <P>



The area is remote and probably not frequently visited. All
      work in the area must have adequate communications facilities and
      emergency procedures in place. Two vehicles in the party is advisable.
      Water is probably the main survival issue. Nearest medical facility is
      Alice Springs. Risk is medium.</td>

    <td width="41%">

The Henbury craters consist of about 12 small craters
      ranging from 6 to 146 m in diameter. They are believed to be the result of
      a single event, the break up of a large iron meteorite at low altitude.
      The bedrock consists of weathered, gently dipping Neoproterozoic shales
      and thin sandstones covered by a veneer of pediment gravels. Formation of
      the crater rims during impact is well exposed. Craters 3 and 4 have
      attracted particular interest as they are the only terrestrial craters to
      show analogues to lunar rays in their ejecta patterns. The main unknown
      features of the geology are the timing of the impact (known only as
      occurring 100's to 1,000's of years ago). More accurate dating using
      thermoluminescence and cosmogenic isotopes is a distinct possibility.
      Detailed regolith mapping also has not been carried out.<P>

3a. Inner crater floor (7). Shale fragments have been washed down the crater sides and deposited on the flat crater floor. The accummulation of moisture here allows for abundant vegetation. An adjacent crater (6) contains an inflowing creek which breaches the crater wall. This has developed an ephemeral swamp and lake depositing organic rich clays. <P>
3b Base of inner crater slope. Exposure of fractured shale whose orientation has been rotated by ~90 deg from its natural orientation. This is an example of several modes of deformation as recorded by Milton (1960?) resulting from the impact. <P>
3c Further up the crater slope the shale is seen to be fragmented and separated into incoherent layers. See figure of Vic pointing. One can trace the individual coloured layers into small fractured folds. The impact fracturing at this point is clearly greater than at 3b. <P>
3d Crest of rim on west side of crater. The lithologies along the crest vary in distinct patches. In places entirely shale fragments in others sandstone fragments. These patches give the impression of radiating ejecta from specific source beds within the crater. The geology of the crater rim shows an overturn of the internal statigrophy. Rounded and subrounded stream gravels that form part of the surface deposits outside the crater may be seen inside the crater at the corresponding level.<P> 

Crater 7 is 180m in diameter and 15m deep. The slope of the crater wall was measured at eight points and varied between 20 and 34 degrees.

  <tr>
    <td width="41%">Discovered in 1922 by Prof. Arthur Aldeman of the University of Adelaide. The Henbury craters were among the first in Australia to be
      recognised as being of impact origin. In addition to
      well-defined craters there is a strewn field of iron meteorite fragments.
      The area was extensively studied in the 1960's by Daniel Milton of the United States
      Geological Survey as a training area for the Apollo program. They are
      Australia's most studied impact craters (as opposed to astrobleme). Crater 3 is the only known terrestrial rayed crater..

  <tr>
    <td width="41%">

Essentially the site is a prime example of the various features associated with meteorite impact. 
Crater is of recent origin (5-10,000 years) and so is less modified by weathering and erosion processes characteristic 
of other Earth impact sites. Studies of the erosion and infill of craters will have important analogue value and a more 
accurate dating of the impact event would have considerable general scientific interest. There are no other features of interest 
here. Provided access is possible, the area is rated good as an example of a particular unusual terrain type.
