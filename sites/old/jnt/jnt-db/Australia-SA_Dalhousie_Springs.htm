</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="41%">Large complex of artesian springs developed in anticlinal
structure of the Great Artesian Basin.&nbsp; The ground water is derived
from deep aquifers and has travelled for long distances through the artesian
basin. The waters emerge at the surface at temperatures of approximately
40 degrees.&nbsp; The groundwater discharge flows north and then east into
the Simpson Desert as a braided stream channel complex.&nbsp; This is currently
dry, but together with the evidence of large extinct mound springs points
to large past discharges.&nbsp; The area is a mosaic of mound springs in
varying stages of activity from extinct through to quiescient and actively
flowing.&nbsp; Intervening areas are characterized by non-focussed ground
water discharge.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>8a.&nbsp; Area typical of surface between springs, patchily vegetated
flat surface consisting of fawn gypsiferous silt colonized by grey pustular
cryptobiotic crust and with puffy texture through crystallization of salts
in the capillary fringe.&nbsp; The surface shows dessication cracks and
patchy halite efflorescence.&nbsp; Sediment pedestals beneath some higher
plants reveal deflation of surface.&nbsp; Excavations reveal that the subsurface
is damp.
<p>8b&nbsp; Cryptobiotic pustular mat, grey in colour on upper flanks of
quiesent mound spring.&nbsp; Soil consists of puffy gypsiferous silt, with
halite efflourence on the lower slopes.&nbsp; Top of mound spring covered
by large trees with very dense understorey of tall grass.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>8c Hot spring on side of active spring crest.&nbsp; Water discharges
at approximately 40 degrees from spring approximately 1 metre deep and
1.5 metres in diameter.&nbsp; Water is clear and discharges at sufficient
rate to feed a stream 50cm deep and approximately one metre deep.&nbsp;
Several vents on the floor of spring discharge large bubbles at the rate
of several per second.&nbsp; A distinctive, sulferous odour is noticeable.&nbsp;
The spring is floored by an emerald green blistered microbial mat and locally
has long filaments of green algae.&nbsp; Local films of ferrihydrite are
present on the surface of the spring and there is an orange ferric hydroxide
crust on the stream bed downstream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>8d Extinct mound spring consists of a hard cap made up of horizontal
slabs of hard cap grey and white fenestral limestone surrounded by eroded
cone of puffy gypsiferous silt.&nbsp; This is a small example, less than
20 metres in extent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

<td WIDTH="41%">The analogue value is threefold.&nbsp; Firstly, the large
area of groundwater discharge and resulting outflow channle provides a
small scale analogue to the large outflow channels which are also believed
to be supplied by ground water. Secondly, the thermal springs and associated
microbial communities provide an analogue for putative Martian oasis associated
with geothermal activity.&nbsp; Thirdly,&nbsp; the sulfate rich soils may
offer similarities to similar salt laden Martian soils.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
