      hazard, and the area should not be visited without two vehicles and
      appropriate supplies of water food, and good communications and emergency
      procedures. The nearest hospital is at Leigh Creek, The risk factors are
      medium-high, increasing with distance away from the Birdsville track.</td>

  <tr>
    <td width="41%">The geology of the area is complex. Gently deformed and
      duricrusted Cretaceous Bulldog shale of marine origin form the gibber
      plain uplands of the Stony desert. Eocene and Miocene fluvial and
      lacustrine sediments have also been weathered and duricrusted, forming
      breakaways. The area is cut by several major ephemeral streams, including
      Coopers Creek, and the desert is flanked by the dunefields of the
      Strezleki desert. There is considerable geological interest in the area
      because of the record of surface environments in the Eyre basin over the
      past 40 million years, and the famous silcrete floras and mammalian
      megafauna. Despite this the area is poorly studied. Almost nothing has
      been published on the regolith and geomorphological history of the Stony
      desert itself. Flowing hot artesian wells along the track have deposited
      locally extensive sinters. The potential for new geological research is
      high.</td>

      Sturt, and Eyre. Subsequently there has been sparse use by pastoralists,
      aided by development of groundwater resources in the Great Artesian Basin.
      The Birdsville track was originally developed as a stock route and then
      upgraded as an access road for the Moomba oil and gas fields. The track
      has becoming increasingly popular as an overland route between Queensland
      and South Australia for trekkers and 4WD enthusiasts.</td>

    <td width="41%">The complex interrelationship of lacustrine, fluvial, and
      aeolian sediments and variable development of duricrusts offer good
      scientific analogues for Mars, although the prevalence of carbonate and
      sulphate soils and sediments may not be. The gibber plains, breakaways,
      channels, and dunes provide a good terrain for marsupial tests, and some
      parts, owing to sparse vegetation, are probably among the best for visual
      analogues. Overall rating very high.</td>
