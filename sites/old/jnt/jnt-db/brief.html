<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>This document provides a very brief outline for Jarntimarra. It will be
important for the team that evolves for the project to properly document there
work.</p>
<h2>DOCUMENT PURPOSE</h2>
<p>The document is intended to help establish the objectives and deliverables to
allow a team of volunteers to be assembled and co-ordinated.</p>
<h1>REFERENCES</h1>
<p>Project participants will need to identify, analyse, collate and distill
suitable reference material.</p>
<h1>THE PROJECT</h1>
<p>Some initial directives for the team (which will be tweaked and compiled into
formal documents in the near future):</p>
<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>Identify sites of interest in Australia for Mars analogue research activities
(could include Antarctic areas)</p>
<h2>BRIEF</h2>
<p>Australia is one of the best places on Earth to undertake Mars analogue
research activities. Key assets include vast unrestricted spaces for
simulations, and natural features bearing a close resemblance to Mars.</p>
<p>For example, consider the possibility of exposing astronauts to seven months
on the International Space Station (about the period expected for the journey to
Mars) and bringing them immediately to Australia to undertake an extended Mars
mission simulation using realistic facilities (habitat, suits, rovers,
communications) etc. Some primary advantages include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Weather conditions are typically favourable (i.e. low rainfall) for
    simulation activities for longer during the year than many other analogue
    sites,</li>
  <li>Crews could roam over a relatively large field of operations (much larger
    than other sites such as Devon Island etc.),</li>
  <li>Support crews have relatively ready access to modern infrastructure,</li>
  <li>The selected field of operations could be found to resemble and contain
    many features of the Martian terrain,</li>
  <li>The simulation would provide a worst case scenario in terms of
    re-adaptation from micro gravity to Martian gravity (0.38 g).</li>
</ol>
<p>Australia is a developed nation with good infrastructure (e.g. roads) and the
continent has been mapped extensively for mineral exploration purposes. Analogue
work can make an important contribution not only to Mars mission planning and
research, but to terrestrial science in the form of paleo, geologic and
contemporary flora and fauna field studies. There is a need to catalogue sites
of interest in Australia (which includes the Australian Antarctic Territory) to
help identify locations for field trips and for a fixed research station, to be
established in 2002.</p>
<h2>NATURE OF WORK</h2>
<p>Primarily research, discussion with professionals in the field and building
links locally and internationally. It will be necessary to seek donated or low
cost map and aerial photo images, and if possible GIS images. Access to GIS
software and data is highly desirable. There may also be software development to
help manage the information.</p>
<h2>DELIVERABLES</h2>
<p>A database containing information, expert analysis, comments, maps and images
of each site and Mars analogues. The team should aim to include detailed
information for at least 24 sites. The intention is to create a
commercial-quality database that will be of interest to international space
agencies when human Mars missions become a reality, creating a valuable asset
for Mars Society Australia.</p>
<h2>TIMELINE</h2>
<p>This is one of the most critical activities currently for Operation Red
Centre.</p>
<h2>COMMENTS</h2>
<p>We should aim for a completely electronic database, possibly web accessible
with password access. Some of the fields to consider for inclusion:</p>
