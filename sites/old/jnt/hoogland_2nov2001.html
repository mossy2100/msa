It appears that the JNT-1 team is having some difficulty with their
communications equipment, which means field reports have not been as
plentiful as we had hoped.  I apologise to anyone who has sent through Q&A's
for our experts - they will get answered and posted when comms are resumed
with the team.<p>

This gives pause to reflect on the communications framework for a Mars
mission, where the crew will need to have a high level of autonomy.  The
Apollo programme used a "mission control" which allowed managers and
principal investigators to direct the action in detail.  In fact, there were
a couple of occassions where this real-time comms saved the mission and
astronaut lives.  Crews were highly trained for all sorts of contingencies,
of course, but the command and control challenges will be magnified several
times when we go to Mars.  What will really be needed is a "mission
support".  Understandably, managers and PI's will want to ensure the mission
is generating maximum bang for its buck, but the systems and crew will need
to be prepared, for example, for some pretty aweful worst case scenarios,
including a prolonged communications blackout.  The crew training
requirements are pretty daunting when seen in this light, and the critical
value of earth-based analogue field rehearsals is brought into stark relief.<p>

Fortunately, the JNT-1 expeditioners are well prepared and know exactly what
they must do.<p>

I have been advised of an odd little article that appeared, and just as
quickly disappeared from an ABC Northern Territory news website.  It
suggested that MSA have not properly consulted with traditional land owners
nor obtained permits to visit national parks.  In fact, we have made every
effort to determine land ownership of sites of interest, and have every
intention of going through a proper consultation process in seeking any land
use agreements that may be necessary.  It is too early at this stage to say
what locations may be of interest.  The support party are experienced
outback tour guides and have obtained all necessary national park permits.
Its interesting how the media can make a story out of thin air!<p>
