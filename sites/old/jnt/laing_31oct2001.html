<h2>WEDNESDAY 31 OCTOBER 2001, 19.45 hours</h2>

Location: Alice Wells<br>

Everyone woke early complaining of ant bites but this was soon
replaced by stoic smiles when the film crew turned up from Imparja
Television to film us. The crew actually left Alice Springs at 6.00 am
to reach us at Henbury Craters, and several of the science party
rewarded this persistence by going out on a quick sortie. They
interviewed Carol and Larry, Graham and James W, with the latter
demonstrating an MCP (mechanical counter pressure) glove worn by Jon
Clarke. The MCP technology applies pressure on the body like an
elastic leotard, and could be used for spacesuits which have greater
mobility than the bulky pressure suits used by the Apollo astronauts
and the current-day astronaut corps. As James told the reporter, the
current EVA suits are essentially a "gas bag" which, when pressurised,
become rigid and inflexible. <p>

It was a marvellous sight, watching the group walk over the ridge in
the soft glow of the early morning.<p>

After a hurried packing up job, the convoy departed for Alice Springs
and provisions.<p>

Lunch at McDonalds or a local bakery while Guy and Michael headed to
an Internet café to check email and respond to queries from Jason, our
`Mission Controller'. Rex drove one vehicle to Australian Air Express
to pick up the MSA banner sent by Marshall, our Treasurer, and we
discovered an unexpected `bonus' - MSA caps - sent to us as a
surprise.<p>

More telephone calls from the media, which is great exposure for
us. We are also attracting interest with our vehicles, with the
prominent MSA and Starchaser logos. Even a rough ride down the Old
Ghan Track road failed to dislodge them.<p>

We headed off down the road, which followed the old Ghan train track,
to our next site - Alice Wells. It was our second hot day, with
temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius, and the air-conditioners were
working overtime. The road was pretty rough in places, but we arrived
in one piece - ready for our next site analysis. A group of
Aboriginals drove up in a van, and waved as we set up camp. We began
our work in the dried-up bed of the Finke River, with our geological
experts Vic and Jon explaining the processes behind the landscape,
while samples and photos were taken. If you blinked, some of the hills
were very Mars-like in appearance, with the rich red copper-coloured
soil providing a stunning backdrop to the photos.<p>

Back at camp, we made a fire and sat around enjoying a pasta dinner,
until the usual line of laptops were set up on trestle tables and work
began. It could be a scene from any office, albeit bathed in ethereal
light from the full moon and a soft breeze.<p>

It's a tough life but someone's got to do it ... <p>
