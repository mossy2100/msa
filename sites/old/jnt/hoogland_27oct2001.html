<center><h1>Jarntimarra Diary - Jason Hoogland</h1></center>
<h2>SATURDAY 27 OCTOBER 2001, 10:00 hrs</h2>
Adelaide, South Australia<br>
Jason Hoogland<p>

And so it began.  Farewelling the Jarntimarra-1 team from the very place Sir
Douglas Mawson had left to explore the Antarctic, my sense of disappointment
at only being able to join them in a week and a half in Arkaroola was
tempered by a quite exhilaration that this was the first real step for our
Australian Mars odyssey.<p>

I had arrived in Adelaide from Brisbane the day before ready to meet
everyone, with little sleep during the previous 48 hours putting together
various details.  Things had been coming together well, it had been a
wonderful team effort.  Our senior support party with vehicles arrived on
time at the Adelaide city hotel, and I met John, Bev, Allan, Beryl (Bev and
Beryl being sisters), Bill, Rhonda and Rex for the first time.  It was only
a few months ago that I had purchased a Westprint map, read about the
company owners on the back and telephoned John to gauge his interest in
JNT-1.  His enthusiasm and support had helped bring us to this point.  Upon
arrival they handled the organised chaos with a relaxed, deliberate ease
pointing to their many years of outback tour experience.<p>

I'd bumped into Jennifer outside the hotel the previous morning.  Returning
from a session of a conference she was reporting on for a client, she had
been juggling the constant telephone calls and discussions with journalists
wanting to know about JNT-1.  The word was getting out - the South China
Post had run a story!  We had a good laugh at that.  I did a couple of
interviews accompanied by Jen and she showed me the Jarntimarra-badged
drinking bottles, before returning to the conference. I crawled into bed to
catch a couple of hours of sleep...<p>

Later I was excited to meet Carol and Larry, who had come out of their 18
hour flight to Australia from San Francisco surprisingly well.  Fortunately
they were able to spread out over a number of spare seats.  Jen put Carol to
work immediately with a telephone interview while Larry and I chatted about
his background.<p>

Jonathan Clarke then arrived with Michael West from Sydney, shortly after
James Waldie arrived from Melbourne.  Michael carried a bag of Jarntimarra
T-Shirts which became our team uniforms.<p>

With everyone excited to learn more about their team mates, we walked to the
Adelaide University Geology Department and met Vic Gostin, Mark Bishop and
James Leydon.  Vic was enthusiastic and invited us to a student barbeque
marking the last day of semester.  We mingled and talked further over some
snags and the local brew, before heading into the Mawson Theatre to prepare
for the public forum Jen and Vic had organised.<p>

The forum was a great opportunity for me to learn more of Carol's work and
perspective, as well as the Mars geomorphologic work of Mark, a Doctoral
student of Vic's and now lecturer at the University of South Australia.
Mark is one of only a handful of Australian academics who has had the
opportunity to undertake direct Mars research - I hope we will see many more
in the years to come.  A primary goal of JNT-1 is to grow this scientific
community, providing the nucleus for the space exploration group within a
hoped-for future Australian space agency.<p>

We returned to the hotel rooms where James showed us the seamless MCP glove
he had been working on with Paul Webb in California, and Jon pulled out some
of his geological maps of the route before we all hit the sack.<p>

The day of departure was hectic, with arrival of the support party and
placement of stickers on the side of the vehicles.  We managed to relax,
however, with a long morning breakfast at the South Australia Museum
followed by a briefing from myself, Jonathan and John.  I distributed a
booklet containing some relevant information including the Jarntimarra
Database and reiterated our objectives, while Jonathan followed up with some
discussion of how he would lead the team on the road and tips such as the
importance of hydration and avoiding snakes.  John explained some of the
camp rules such as the environmental importance of burning toilet paper,
which can last for years in the dry outback.<p>

Some members of the team then wandered around the museum while Jonathan,
James, Michael and myself tested the satellite phone.  The phone worked
well, we just had trouble sending and receiving email, which would allow
daily field reports to be returned for the website.  We fiddled for some
time before I decided to buy an interface cable that eventually solved the
problem.  Jonathan and I made a quick dash to a map shop to fill a couple of
minor gaps in data available to the team on the road.  Finally, Graham
arrived in from Perth and explained how he'd needed every last minute in the
lead up to gather cadastral (land ownership) information that would allow
the team to readily consult with land owners on the road.<p>

Following some final photographs, the team got away just 15 minutes behind
schedule on a beautiful Adelaide morning, fully equipped, fully experienced
and fully enthusiastic about the adventure ahead.<p>

I then had an opportunity to explore a wonderful Mawson exhibit at the SA
Museum.  The parallels between the life, work and interests of Sir Douglas,
our efforts and the journey to Mars were absolutely uncanny. Mawson is truly
an inspiration not just to Australians but surely to Mars advocates the
world over - highly educated yet practical and at his best in the field,
with an unbending will and determination, and a precise, analytical and
scientific mind.  He sought to understand the hostile Antarctic for the
benefit of science but as a mining engineer and geologist was an advocate of
well managed of resource utilisation for the benefit of society.  He exposed
himself to the perils of the Antarctic and prevailed.<p>

His geological laboratory was the Flinders Ranges and he inspired and
mentored dozens of leading scientists who have helped make central Australia
one of the world's most important paleo-geologic provinces for understanding
the first life on Earth.  Mawson was a Mars pioneer ahead of his time, he
would have been very pleased to join Jarntimarra-1.<p>
