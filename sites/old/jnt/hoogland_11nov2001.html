The Jarntimarra-1 expedition was an extremely satisfying success.  With the
team returning to Adelaide yesterday from Arkaroola, the level of enthusiasm
surpassed that displayed even when it left the South Australian Museum two
weeks earlier, despite the gruelling schedule and difficult conditions.  A
number of immediate outcomes have been achieved.<p>

First, we have inspired a core of scientific and engineering talent that
will more rapidly advance our goals.  A number of team members were only
broadly familiar with the MSA technical programme and that of our
international colleagues.  Several expressed real surprise at the breadth,
importance and feasibility of our vision and their excitement gives me
confidence we now have a core of local talent that having met face to face,
understands the challenges and will go forth as champions of our vision.<p>

Second, the team in fact contributed to this vision.  Whilst at Arkaroola,
it engaged in a series of intensive workshops to map out a more detailed
plan for MSA technical activities over the coming years.  This was also a
wonderful demonstration of collegiate-style debate and discussion leading to
collective ownership that will give rise to a more robust and ultimately
more successful technical programme.<p>

Third, the team
developed a preliminary science and engineering plan for Operation Red
Centre (ORC), in which Mars-Oz will be a centre-piece.<p>

Finally, the team identified three regions with strong potential for use as
analogue research stages - Arkaringa near Coober Pedy, the Woomera area and
the Arkaroola region.  A press release will contain more details, but some
time soon I'll explain why and how one of these localities has been chosen
for the first ORC activities in 2002 or 2003.<p>

Overall, JNT-1 achieved and exceeded all our objectives and our next step is
to consolidate the huge steps taken, recruit talent into our projects and,
most important of all, raise the financial and in-kind support needed to see
ORC to fruition with all its hardware elements.  We now have the capability
to undertake genuinely world class research that will advance our
understanding of Mars and better prepare us for human missions to the Red
Planet - all we need now is the support to make it happen.<p>
