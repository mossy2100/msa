<h1>JARNTIMARRA EXPEDITION DIARIES</H1>

<h2>JASON HOOGLAND</h2>

<h3>Saturday 27 October 2001, 10:00 hrs</h3>
Adelaide, South Australia<br><br>

And so it began.  Farewelling the Jarntimarra-1 team from the very place Sir
Douglas Mawson had left to explore the Antarctic, my sense of disappointment
at only being able to join them in a week and a half in Arkaroola was
tempered by a quite exhilaration that this was the first real step for our
Australian Mars odyssey.<p>

I had arrived in Adelaide from Brisbane the day before ready to meet
everyone, with little sleep during the previous 48 hours putting together
various details.  Things had been coming together well, it had been a
wonderful team effort.  Our senior support party with vehicles arrived on
time at the Adelaide city hotel, and I met John, Bev, Allan, Beryl (Bev and
Beryl being sisters), Bill, Rhonda and Rex for the first time.  It was only
a few months ago that I had purchased a Westprint map, read about the
company owners on the back and telephoned John to gauge his interest in
JNT-1.  His enthusiasm and support had helped bring us to this point.  Upon
arrival they handled the organised chaos with a relaxed, deliberate ease
pointing to their many years of outback tour experience.<p>

I'd bumped into Jennifer outside the hotel the previous morning.  Returning
from a session of a conference she was reporting on for a client, she had
been juggling the constant telephone calls and discussions with journalists
wanting to know about JNT-1.  The word was getting out - the South China
Post had run a story!  We had a good laugh at that.  I did a couple of
interviews accompanied by Jen and she showed me the Jarntimarra-badged
drinking bottles, before returning to the conference. I crawled into bed to
catch a couple of hours of sleep...<p>

Later I was excited to meet Carol and Larry, who had come out of their 18
hour flight to Australia from San Francisco surprisingly well.  Fortunately
they were able to spread out over a number of spare seats.  Jen put Carol to
work immediately with a telephone interview while Larry and I chatted about
his background.<p>

Jonathan Clarke then arrived with Michael West from Sydney, shortly after
James Waldie arrived from Melbourne.  Michael carried a bag of Jarntimarra
T-Shirts which became our team uniforms.<p>

With everyone excited to learn more about their team mates, we walked to the
Adelaide University Geology Department and met Vic Gostin, Mark Bishop and
James Leydon.  Vic was enthusiastic and invited us to a student barbeque
marking the last day of semester.  We mingled and talked further over some
snags and the local brew, before heading into the Mawson Theatre to prepare
for the public forum Jen and Vic had organised.<p>

The forum was a great opportunity for me to learn more of Carol's work and
perspective, as well as the Mars geomorphologic work of Mark, a Doctoral
student of Vic's and now lecturer at the University of South Australia.
Mark is one of only a handful of Australian academics who has had the
opportunity to undertake direct Mars research - I hope we will see many more
in the years to come.  A primary goal of JNT-1 is to grow this scientific
community, providing the nucleus for the space exploration group within a
hoped-for future Australian space agency.<p>

We returned to the hotel rooms where James showed us the seamless MCP glove
he had been working on with Paul Webb in California, and Jon pulled out some
of his geological maps of the route before we all hit the sack.<p>

The day of departure was hectic, with arrival of the support party and
placement of stickers on the side of the vehicles.  We managed to relax,
however, with a long morning breakfast at the South Australia Museum
followed by a briefing from myself, Jonathan and John.  I distributed a
booklet containing some relevant information including the Jarntimarra
Database and reiterated our objectives, while Jonathan followed up with some
discussion of how he would lead the team on the road and tips such as the
importance of hydration and avoiding snakes.  John explained some of the
camp rules such as the environmental importance of burning toilet paper,
which can last for years in the dry outback.<p>

Some members of the team then wandered around the museum while Jonathan,
James, Michael and myself tested the satellite phone.  The phone worked
well, we just had trouble sending and receiving email, which would allow
daily field reports to be returned for the website.  We fiddled for some
time before I decided to buy an interface cable that eventually solved the
problem.  Jonathan and I made a quick dash to a map shop to fill a couple of
minor gaps in data available to the team on the road.  Finally, Graham
arrived in from Perth and explained how he'd needed every last minute in the
lead up to gather cadastral (land ownership) information that would allow
the team to readily consult with land owners on the road.<p>

Following some final photographs, the team got away just 15 minutes behind
schedule on a beautiful Adelaide morning, fully equipped, fully experienced
and fully enthusiastic about the adventure ahead.<p>

I then had an opportunity to explore a wonderful Mawson exhibit at the SA
Museum.  The parallels between the life, work and interests of Sir Douglas,
our efforts and the journey to Mars were absolutely uncanny. Mawson is truly
an inspiration not just to Australians but surely to Mars advocates the
world over - highly educated yet practical and at his best in the field,
with an unbending will and determination, and a precise, analytical and
scientific mind.  He sought to understand the hostile Antarctic for the
benefit of science but as a mining engineer and geologist was an advocate of
well managed of resource utilisation for the benefit of society.  He exposed
himself to the perils of the Antarctic and prevailed.<p>

His geological laboratory was the Flinders Ranges and he inspired and
mentored dozens of leading scientists who have helped make central Australia
one of the world's most important paleo-geologic provinces for understanding
the first life on Earth.  Mawson was a Mars pioneer ahead of his time, he
would have been very pleased to join Jarntimarra-1.<p>

Brisbane, Queensland<br><br>


Having just spoken with MSA President Guy Murphy from Alice Springs, the
expedition is travelling well and has been extremely busy.  Yesterday the
party did not have the opportunity to log in via the sat phone and deliver
diary reports (but will make up for this tonight!), being pre-occupied with
three TV crews whilst at Henbury Craters south of Alice.<p>

Channels 2 (the national broadcaster, ABC) and 9 shot extensive footage of
the party in the Henbury area, with Channel 9 hiring a helicopter for the
day.  We've been advised the Channel 2 footage may go to air this Thursday
night on the national Catalyst science show, while the Channel 9 footage may
be used on the national morning Today show late next week.  Channel 7 have
shown interest in possibly filming the expedition along the Birdsville Track
later this week.<p>

Keep your eyes and ears peeled MSA members!  One objective of JNT-1 is to
raise the profile of our activities nationally, and the technical party
understands the need to pay the research bills via quality PR.<p>

Conditions have been hot in Alice Springs (36 degrees Celsius), although the
party should find things cool down as they return south.  Although the
region remains arid, it has been unseasonally rainy during the winter and
spring, and temperatures in the remaining areas of interest are expected to
remain mild in the mid to high 20's.<p>

So, the expedition now returns to the serious business of surveying sites
for the Jarntimarra Database and I am looking forward to the hot artesian
bore sampling that remains along the Birdsville track.

<h3>Friday 2 November 2001, 16:30 hrs</h3>
Brisbane, Queensland<br><br>

It appears that the JNT-1 team is having some difficulty with their
communications equipment, which means field reports have not been as
plentiful as we had hoped.  I apologise to anyone who has sent through Q&A's
for our experts - they will get answered and posted when comms are resumed
with the team.<p>

This gives pause to reflect on the communications framework for a Mars
mission, where the crew will need to have a high level of autonomy.  The
Apollo programme used a "mission control" which allowed managers and
principal investigators to direct the action in detail.  In fact, there were
a couple of occassions where this real-time comms saved the mission and
astronaut lives.  Crews were highly trained for all sorts of contingencies,
of course, but the command and control challenges will be magnified several
times when we go to Mars.  What will really be needed is a "mission
support".  Understandably, managers and PI's will want to ensure the mission
is generating maximum bang for its buck, but the systems and crew will need
to be prepared, for example, for some pretty aweful worst case scenarios,
including a prolonged communications blackout.  The crew training
requirements are pretty daunting when seen in this light, and the critical
value of earth-based analogue field rehearsals is brought into stark relief.<p>

Fortunately, the JNT-1 expeditioners are well prepared and know exactly what
they must do.<p>

I have been advised of an odd little article that appeared, and just as
quickly disappeared from an ABC Northern Territory news website.  It
suggested that MSA have not properly consulted with traditional land owners
nor obtained permits to visit national parks.  In fact, we have made every
effort to determine land ownership of sites of interest, and have every
intention of going through a proper consultation process in seeking any land
use agreements that may be necessary.  It is too early at this stage to say
what locations may be of interest.  The support party are experienced
outback tour guides and have obtained all necessary national park permits.
Its interesting how the media can make a story out of thin air!

<h3>Sunday 11 November 2001, 23:00 hrs</h3>
Brisbane, Queensland<br><br>

The Jarntimarra-1 expedition was an extremely satisfying success.  With the
team returning to Adelaide yesterday from Arkaroola, the level of enthusiasm
surpassed that displayed even when it left the South Australian Museum two
weeks earlier, despite the gruelling schedule and difficult conditions.  A
number of immediate outcomes have been achieved.<p>

First, we have inspired a core of scientific and engineering talent that
will more rapidly advance our goals.  A number of team members were only
broadly familiar with the MSA technical programme and that of our
international colleagues.  Several expressed real surprise at the breadth,
importance and feasibility of our vision and their excitement gives me
confidence we now have a core of local talent that having met face to face,
understands the challenges and will go forth as champions of our vision.<p>

Second, the team in fact contributed to this vision.  Whilst at Arkaroola,
it engaged in a series of intensive workshops to map out a more detailed
plan for MSA technical activities over the coming years.  This was also a
wonderful demonstration of collegiate-style debate and discussion leading to
collective ownership that will give rise to a more robust and ultimately
more successful technical programme.<p>

Third, the team
developed a preliminary science and engineering plan for Operation Red
Centre (ORC), in which Mars-Oz will be a centre-piece.<p>

Finally, the team identified three regions with strong potential for use as
analogue research stages - Arkaringa near Coober Pedy, the Woomera area and
the Arkaroola region.  A press release will contain more details, but some
time soon I'll explain why and how one of these localities has been chosen
for the first ORC activities in 2002 or 2003.<p>

Overall, JNT-1 achieved and exceeded all our objectives and our next step is
to consolidate the huge steps taken, recruit talent into our projects and,
most important of all, raise the financial and in-kind support needed to see
ORC to fruition with all its hardware elements.  We now have the capability
to undertake genuinely world class research that will advance our
understanding of Mars and better prepare us for human missions to the Red
Planet - all we need now is the support to make it happen.
