Having just spoken with MSA President Guy Murphy from Alice Springs, the
expedition is travelling well and has been extremely busy.  Yesterday the
party did not have the opportunity to log in via the sat phone and deliver
diary reports (but will make up for this tonight!), being pre-occupied with
three TV crews whilst at Henbury Craters south of Alice.<p>

Channels 2 (the national broadcaster, ABC) and 9 shot extensive footage of
the party in the Henbury area, with Channel 9 hiring a helicopter for the
day.  We've been advised the Channel 2 footage may go to air this Thursday
night on the national Catalyst science show, while the Channel 9 footage may
be used on the national morning Today show late next week.  Channel 7 have
shown interest in possibly filming the expedition along the Birdsville Track
later this week.<p>

Keep your eyes and ears peeled MSA members!  One objective of JNT-1 is to
raise the profile of our activities nationally, and the technical party
understands the need to pay the research bills via quality PR.<p>

Conditions have been hot in Alice Springs (36 degrees Celsius), although the
party should find things cool down as they return south.  Although the
region remains arid, it has been unseasonally rainy during the winter and
spring, and temperatures in the remaining areas of interest are expected to
remain mild in the mid to high 20's.<p>

So, the expedition now returns to the serious business of surveying sites
for the Jarntimarra Database and I am looking forward to the hot artesian
bore sampling that remains along the Birdsville track.<p>
