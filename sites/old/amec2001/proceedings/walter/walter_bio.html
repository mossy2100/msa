Malcolm Walter is Adjunct Professor of geology at Macquarie University in 
Sydney, Director of the Australian Centre for Astrobiology based at that 
university,  and Director of M. R. Walter Pty Ltd. He has worked for 35 
years on the geological evidence of early life on Earth, including the earliest 
convincing evidence of life. Since 1989 he has been funded by NASA in 
their "exobiology" and "astrobiology" programs, focussing on microbial life 
in high temperature ecosystems, and the search for life on Mars. During 
1999 his book "The Search for Life on Mars" was published by Allen & 
Unwin. He has published more than 100 articles and several other books. 
He also works as an oil exploration consultant and a consultant to

exhibition on space exploration (for the new Museum of Australia in 
Canberra, Museum Victoria, and elsewhere).
