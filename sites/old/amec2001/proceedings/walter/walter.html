<em>
Places such as Devon Island are analogues for the present environment of 
Mars. But another category of analogues is also important: those places 
that resemble ancient environments that might have hosted life, such as 
former lakes and thermal springs.  In Australia we have numerous such 
places, including gold deposits in central Queensland,  a giant lead-zinc-
silver deposit in the NT, Mount Painter in SA, and many sites in WA. Some 
of these are also analogues for aspects of the current environment on 
Mars. Mt Painter is one such; it is one of the World's largest ancient thermal 
spring systems, has an active thermal spring nearby, and is flanked by arid 
plains, dunes and salt lakes. It is an excellent site for conducting simulation 
experiments.</em>
