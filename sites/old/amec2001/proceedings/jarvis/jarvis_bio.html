Professor Ray Jarvis completed his BE (Elec.) and Ph.D. (Elec.) at the 
University of Western Australia in 1962 and 1968, respectively. 

After two year at Purdue University he was appointed to the Australian 
National University (ANU) to teach Computer Science. There he was 
instrumental in establishing the Department of Computer Science at ANU, 
and was its first Head of Department. 

He joined Monash University in 1985 and established the Intelligent Robotic 
Research Centre in 1987. He has been the Centre's Director since then. 
His research interests are in Computer Vision and Robotics. Both robotic 
manipulators and mobile robots of various sizes have been part of his 
interests. Most recently he has been working on autonomous and 
teleoperated vehicles and vessels including a tacked vehicle, several boats, 
an amphibious craft, an excavator and a half scale Russian built Martian 
Rover. He has also recently developed a research interest in Humanoid 
Robotics. From an AI perceptive his main interests are in Computer Vision 
and Path Planning.
