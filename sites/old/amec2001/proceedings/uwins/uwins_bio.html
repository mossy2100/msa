Dr Philippa Uwins is a Senior Research Fellow at The University of 
Queensland, Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis. She has a degree in 
Geology from the University of Edinburgh (1982), and a Ph.D in Palynology 
(the study of organic microfossils) from the University of Aberdeen (1987). 
She then worked for one year at Robertson Research International's head 
office in North Wales as a palynologist. She has been at the University of 
Queensland, Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis since 1989. Her 
research has focussed on phytoplankton ecology and water quality 
monitoring, clay mineralogy, catalyst chemistry, microscopy research and 
techniques (specialising in Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy 
(ESEM) and ultra-high resolution Field Emission SEM (FESEM)). More 
recently her work has focussed on the molecular, morphological and 
ultrastructural characterisation of novel nano-organisms called nanobes.
