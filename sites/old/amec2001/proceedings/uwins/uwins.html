On August 7th 1996 NASA made the historic announcement that Martian 
Meteorite ALH84001 could contain evidence for past life on Mars. Central 
to the thesis, and perhaps the most controversial aspect of the findings, 
were the fossil remnants of sub-bacteria sized "cells" called nannobacteria. 
While the results were of great scientific interest they fuelled a fierce and 
highly contentious debate, not only concerning the existence of Martian 
microbes, but a controversy surrounding the minimum possible size of life 
on earth. <p>
The identification and existence of nanobacteria was not new and had been 
proposed previously by a number of workers. However, the likelihood of 
such small cells existing was strongly questioned, since it was argued that 
these cells would have been far too small to carry out the metabolic and 
reproductive processes essential for life. It has remained unresolved to this 
day whether these mineralised nannobacteria were fossilised remnants of 
independent life forms, artefacts of sample preparation or unusual mineral 
deposits.<p>

However, more recently, we reported on the existence of novel nano-
organisms (nanobes) growing on Triassic and Jurassic sandstones 
collected from petroleum exploration boreholes offshore Western Australia. 
These filamentous, pleomorphic and yeast-like cells provide further 
evidence for nano-scopic life. Because these cells were so much smaller 
than any known microbe, they were given the name 'nanobe'. <p>

Nanobes will be described, illustrated and discussed within the context of 
the nanobacterial debate. If nanobes are novel life forms as claimed, how 
will their existence impact on our understanding of three fundamental 
questions, What is life? How did it evolve? and Is there life beyond earth?
