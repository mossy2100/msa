Dr John Webb

I attended Queensland University, where I obtained my Honours (with a 
University Medal) and PhD degrees (the latter in 1982). My thesis was on 
Triassic palaeobotany of southeastern Queensland, but since completing it 
my interests have broadened, to include geomorphology and Antarctic 
geology. After finishing my thesis I taught for 5 years at Melbourne 
University Geology Department, then moved to La Trobe University Earth 
Sciences in 1985, where I teach sedimentology and environmental geology. 
At the moment I'm Head of Department. Over the summer of 1989-1990 I 
went to Antarctica for a field season in the northern Prince Charles 
Mountains, studying Permo-Triassic sedimentology and the recent 
geomorphology.
