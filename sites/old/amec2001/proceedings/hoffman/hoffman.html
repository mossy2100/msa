<em>
On Earth, life requires water, therefore our search for life beyond the Earth 
is a search for water. For this reason we target Europa, a moon of Jupiter that may 
have a liquid ocean beneath a thick icy crust, and also Mars where huge erosional 
channels suggest the flow of fluids across the surface in the geological past. Many 
scientists believe that rivers and lakes existed in the past on Mars, and perhaps 
even oceans. However, this search on Mars may be ill-founded. Despite intense 
research, the evidence for water on Mars is scarce. Now a new theory suggests 
that the single strongest line of evidence for water on Mars - the "outburst flood 
channels" may have been formed not by liquid water but by cold dry eruptions of 
gas, dust and rock, fuelled by exploding liquid CO2.</em>
