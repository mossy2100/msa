<h1>PDF-Validation - explanation</h1>
<p>The uploaded file is processed by a pdf-validation tool. This tool tries to validate the file against a profile from IEEE to check for IEEE Xplore compatibility.</p>
<p>If your file is not a pdf document, the report will be meaningless. But refer to the conference information page, if non pdf documents are allowed.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Different States</h2>
<table rules="cols">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>unknown</td>
      <td>Your file is being processed. This may take up to 10 min. If, after this time, the state remains "unknown" the validation server is not responding. After some time, you may try to upload the same file again. This will restart the validation process.<br />You may consider writing an email to the technical administrator of the conference (not to the iaprcommence developers!)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>invalid</td>
      <td>The validation process was completed sucessfully, but your document does not comply to IEEE Xplore standards. This may of no cencern to you, if the paper is not to be published at IEEE Xplore.<br />Have a look at the report (View Paper Details); the most common mistake is to not embed <em>and</em> subset <em>all</em> fonts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>valid</td>
      <td>The uploaded file does comply with IEEE Xplore specifications.</td>
    </tr>
