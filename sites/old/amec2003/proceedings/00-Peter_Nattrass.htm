  Guy Murphy, president of the Mar Society, and Dr <span class=SpellE>Vadim</span>
  <span class=SpellE>Gushin</span>, all the way from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
   w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> and Ray <span class=SpellE>Priskich</span>
  and ladies and gentlemen here today. It is always a pleasure to welcome
  anyone to this wonderful city that we’re so proud of, and when it includes so
  many of you from over east and especially from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
   w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> that pleasure is even more so.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To those of you from overseas may I remind
  you that you are now in the most isolated capital city in the world, and if
  we were drill a hole through the core of the earth from Perth we’d end up at
  Washington DC, but isolation I guess is a very relative term, when the object
  of your attention here this weekend is some 56 million km away from Perth and
  in that perspective, a visit here to this city is not too remote after wall,
  and it certainly shouldn’t be too difficult to come to a beautiful city like
  Perth because we’re very proud that last year that widely respected magazine
  the Economist voted Perth the third most friendliest city in the world. In
  the same year the widely read international magazine US Travel and Leisure voted
  Perth the friendliest city in the world, and in the same year it was voted internationally
  one of the 10 cleanest cities in the world, so we’re very proud indeed of our
  city and we’re delighted that you have come over here for this conference.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>Western Australians have maintained a special interest in space travel dating
  right back to 1962 I think it was, when John Glenn flew around in Friendship
  7. I was brought up in that era and I can remember the Mercury capsule being
  brought here and travelling along the streets of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
   w:st="on">Perth</st1:place></st1:City>, and certainly I can remember the
  Sputnik first going over and Yuri Gagarin. What a contribution Yuri Gagarin made!
  <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>While Alan Shepard was the first in
  space to go up and down that <span class=GramE>was</span> nothing when Yuri Gagarin
  was the first to go around, and what a tragic end to life he had after having
  achieved that.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>But when John Glenn went over we all got out there and turned all our
  lights on, every conceivable light in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Perth</st1:place></st1:City>
  was turned on. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Lord Mayor of the
  day got into a lot of strife because when it was suggested that the people of
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Perth</st1:place></st1:City> turn on
  their lights he said ‘what a terrible waste of money’. His name was Harry Howard
  and he said what a terrible waste of money and the media went mad saying ‘what
  a silly thing to say’. Anyway, when John Glenn came back to earth, he had a
  ticket tape parade in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">New York</st1:State></st1:place>.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mayor of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
   w:st="on">new York</st1:place></st1:State> invited Harry Howard to go over
  to the ticket tape parade, and he got into more trouble because <span
  class=GramE>her</span> said yes.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>And again 17 years late Western Australia again felt connected with space
  travel because Skylab crashed into a very remote little town, or just outside
  a remote little town called <span class=SpellE>Balladonia</span>, and I can remember
  jimmy cater ringing up the pub in <span class=SpellE>Balladonia</span> to
  apologise for Skylab. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>And the
  subsequent to that the US ambassador brought Miss American out to Perth and
  they drove out to <span class=SpellE>Balladonia</span> to see where Skylab landed,
  so we do have an association with space travel and we feel a connection.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>And again in 1998 when John Glenn went up in the Discovery a new
  generation of Western Australians enthusiastically embraced space
  travel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can remember that occasion
  well because we all went up to a prearranged place up near Kings Park and
  there was going to be a direct broadcast between me as mayor and John Glenn,
  and we had that broadcast. Immediately after all the television crews were
  there, and Channel 7 here in Perth had asked me 5 minutes before would I come
  on and do a little interview after I had spoken with John Glenn and I said sure,
  but after I had spoken to John Glenn this lone television man with a camera,
  no support crew, or he didn’t seem to have a support crew, came up to me and
  said would I do an interview with him? and he had an American accent and I said
  look I’m sorry I, I can’t I’m already committed, and he said ‘oh, ok’, and I said
  why don’t you get (I was with) Julie Bishop, a Perth girl, she’s standing
  over there doing nothing and she speaks very well, so this lone camera man
  interviewed Julie Bishop and 5 minutes later her mobile phone went and it was
  a friend of hers in Times Square, New York, She had appeared on that great screen
  in Times Square and I’d just done this little interview in Perth.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>But on that occasion in 1998, it was a new generation of Western Australians
  who came out and turned on the lights for John Glenn, and they were a new generation
  because they were more informed and a more sophisticated generation because
  they had grown up with an <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>understanding
  of space travel, aided and assisted by all the modern technology we have
  today, such as that which this school of Trinity is so blessed as having, where
  students and academics can come together at an equal level and have a role in
  being involved in international astronomical events and also contribute in their
  own small away in space research, and indeed I understand that is happening with
  the <span class=SpellE>Starchaser</span> Marsupial, the rover, and also with
  the European space agency ground stations coming along at New <span
  class=SpellE>Norcia</span><o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>With Mars closer now than its ever been over the last 60,000 years, it
  nice to know that fuel consumption is a major factor in there now being four
  space probes now heading toward Mars, one due there on Christmas day this
  year, one from Europe, 2 from the United States and one from Japan, so this
  also indicate that space travel is now very much an<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>multinational affair.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>So we’re delighted here in Perth that the clear skies, the open spaces,
  what is apparently termed radio quiet and the very sparse regional populations
  in Western Australia create the ideal conditions that attract astronomers and
  space researchers for the city that we’re so proud of. So we extend all of
  your from the east our welcome; we’re proud of our city<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and we hope that while you’re here you have
  time for more earthly pursuits than thinking about mars and you get an
  opportunity to go to some of the attractions that we think make Perth unique.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of <span class=GramE>all,</span> may
  your visit here be both rewarding and enjoyable, and particularly when you go
  back to <st1:City w:st="on">Moscow</st1:City> (Mr <span class=SpellE>Gushin</span>),
  we hope that you take with you very fond memories of your stay here in <st1:City
  w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Perth</st1:place></st1:City>, memories that
  will last a lifetime.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>Thank-you.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
