          <p style='text-align:justify'><a name=Abstract><b>Abstract:</b> </a>Involvement in public relations has been an element of an astronaut’s career since the days of the early space program, hitting its zenith of importance in the Apollo era, when human beings first walked on the moon and some became household names. Since then, astronauts and cosmonauts have retreated into relative anonymity, while still continuing PR work such as school visits and presentations to businesses, when not in serious training for a spaceflight. The first human mission to Mars is likely to change this low-key approach to PR, with the eyes of potentially millions of people around the world transfixed on what might arguably be the greatest human endeavour so far in history. Technological developments such as the growth of the Internet and Webcams and the introduction of ‘reality TV’ and increasing interest in obtaining a ‘birds-eye’ view of world events have transformed likely expectations as to the level and type of information that would be transmitted back to Earth. The first humans on Mars will therefore need to be both skilled and interested in communications, to be able to satisfy the public’s curiosity for knowledge and to translate what they are seeing and experiencing in a way that is understandable to all. Analogue research at places such as the Mars Desert Research Station during Expedition One and the Australian Outback during the <span class=SpellE>Jarntimarra</span> expedition and proposed Expedition Two may assist in understanding views on the role of PR, and identifying training needs and problems and challenges associated with PR with reference to typical future Mars crews.</p>
