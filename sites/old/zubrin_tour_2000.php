Dr. Robert Zubrin's Australian Tour
</span>

<br>
<br>
<span class="bodytext">
	Mars Society President Dr Robert Zubrin recently visited Australia on a lecture 
	tour during March of this year. 

<br>
<br>
	The itinerary took him to Sydney, Adelaide, 
	Melbourne and Brisbane, where he lectured to several thousand people and appeared 
	at other smaller events.  The tour was organised by  members of the Mars Society and National 
	Space Society of Australia, with assistance from individuals from a range of other 
	space-related associations and universities.  Dr Zubrin was interviewed by three 
	newspapers, three TV stations, and about twenty radio shows, including ‘The Science 
	Show’ and ‘Ask Dr Karl’ on the ABC. 

<br>
<br>
	In his talks, Zubrin emphasized that Australia, which produced some of the world's greatest 
	explorers in the past, should not allow itself to be left out of the defining human 
	activity of the 21st century, the exploration of space. He also pointed out that pleas 
	of inadequate resources don't wash. "The Pathfinder Mission cost $175 million," he said.
	 "Australia could afford that. That's the price of a shopping mall. It is a disgrace 
	that for the past forty years, Australian politicians have told the country's brightest 
	young people: 'If you want to explore space, emigrate.'"
