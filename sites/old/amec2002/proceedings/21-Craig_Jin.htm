<B><P><A NAME="abstract">Abstract:</A></B> This paper presents a model system and technology that we are building to investigate the issues important to achieving a psychophysically-adapted mobile outdoor augmented reality (AR) system. These issues are important in situations where human interaction and deployment is necessary and in which unencumbered information delivery to the human explorer is essential. Typical application scenarios for AR technology involve situations in which the overlaying of visual and auditory information onto a real sensory environment enhances the worker’s effectiveness. Relevant to the context of this paper are situations that include the proposed manned space exploration missions (such as of the planet Mars, associated with our point of contact, The Mars Society) and also the Mars Analogue Research Stations being developed to prepare for such expeditions. Our particular focus is developing inter-personal spatial-audio communication head-sets (the talkers’ voices are heard as externalized or out-of-the-head and originating from specific directions in space) that enhance auditory situational awareness. In addition, we are applying image recognition techniques via a head-mounted video camera to provide real-time assistance in the categorization and collection of image data. A transparent head-mounted visual display system (HMD) provides additional visual information to the user.</P>
<B><P><A NAME="profile">PROFILE:</B> </A><I>Craig Jin is currently a Lecturer in the School of Electrical and Information Engineering at the University of Sydney. Together with Andr&eacute; van Schaik, he heads the Computing and Augmented Reality Laboratory and maintains active research collaborations with the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of Sydney. He holds 2 patents in the area of 3D audio engineering and has recently presented 3 tutorial papers on implementing 3D audio at the 2001 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia Information Processing. Prior to working at the University of Sydney, he worked for 3 years at a successful start-up company, the Virtual Computer Corporation (VCC), in Reseda, California. At VCC, Craig was 1 of 4 researchers who created two series of computers based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), one of which won the 1995 NASA Small Business Innovative Research Technology of the Year Award (NASA Tech Briefs 19, 1995).</I></TD>
