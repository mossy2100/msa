<B><P>ABSTRACT</P>
</B><P>This paper will provide a broad overview of the nature of the Mars Analogue Research Station (MARS-OZ), why the site was selected, and the design of the habitat. I will then discuss specific opportunities for education, outreach and tourism, relating MARS-OZ to other Australian activities.</P>
<P>The Mars Society is an international private organisation advocating the exploration and settlement of Mars. Part of its mission involves selecting areas for Martian analogue research, to test hardware, technology, strategies and human factors relevant to sending people to Mars.</P>
<P>Mars Society Australia has selected the Arkaroola region in the Flinders Ranges as the site for the first Australian analogue facility, to be built in 2003. It will be known as MARS-OZ.</P>
<P>In addition to its value as a research base, MARS-OZ will be a useful public education and outreach tool about Mars analogue research and its role in future human Mars missions; demonstrating tools, processes and technology under development. By showcasing terrestrial analogues to Martian environments, it will also help to make Mars more real for the general public. Schools could use MARS-OZ as a focus for educational resources and the development of curricula, as a means of encouraging more students to pursue careers in science and technology fields.</P>
<P>There may also be tourism potential in MARS-OZ, as a local attraction in close proximity to the Arkaroola resort, and as an innovative accommodation facility for those interested in experiencing what it might be like to live on a Mars base.</P>
<B><P>INTRODUCTION</P>
</B><P>Mars Society Australia (MSA) is an incorporated non-profit organisation, part of an international movement spanning some 50 countries world-wide, which is dedicated to the exploration and settlement of the planet Mars. Members are drawn from all walks of life - science, engineering, astronomy, astronautics, academia and the general public.</P>
<P>Part of its mission involves selecting areas for Martian analogue research, to test hardware, technology, strategies and human factors, which will have an application to future human Mars exploration. MSA is also working on public outreach programs and encouraging government endorsement and funding of Mars exploration.</P>
<B><P>Mars Analogue Research in Australia</P>
</B><P>Martian analogue sites are sites on Earth that possess characteristics similar or <I>analogous</I> to environments on Mars.</P>
<P>Australia offers a number of advantages for Mars analogue research (Clarke, J. quoted in Laing 2002). Recent motion pictures such as <I>Red Planet </I>have used location footage in the Australian Outback around areas like Coober Pedy to portray the Martian landscape. Its red soil and rocky terrain provides a visual analogue. Features have been identified that bear close resemblance to those observed or anticipated on Mars, such as groundwater discharge areas such as mound springs, thermal springs and fresh or salty discharge channels, and stream channels of infrequent mega-floods that also interface with sand dunes. Long traverses are available with minimal impediments, which will be important for testing of the Starchaser Marsupial Rover operations from base. There is abundant dust, and the need for dust control, as well as general dryness and the presence of salts. Some Australian rocks are as old as Martian rocks and date from time when differences between the two planets may have been smaller. Australia's ancient regolith (weathered rocks, groundwater, and sediments) and ancient eroded landscapes also provide valuable analogues to those on Mars.</P>
<P>FIGURE 1 - Australia as a Mars Analogue</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/amec2002/proceedings/Image63.jpg" WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=337></P>
<P>Research on these sites will help to address issues which need to be tackled before humans can be sent to Mars, such as the manner in which crews will explore the surface and methods of interaction with each other, their equipment, the environment and mission controllers in the face of such remoteness.</P>
<P>Analogue sites could be used by researchers wanting to prove the functionality, durability and usability of space technology and hardware. <I>Free-ranging </I>mission simulations using a suite of realistic analogue hardware and logistics (e.g. communications) could also be used as dress-rehearsals for Mars missions.</P>
<P>At the moment, such research is being undertaken by a number of different centres and institutions around Australia. There is a need for a focal point or central location, which draws this type of work and these types of researchers together. The appreciation of this need led to the proposal for MARS-OZ, the centrepiece of MSA’s suite of technical projects, titled Operation Red Centre (ORC).</P>
<B><P>Establishment of a Mars Analogue Research Base</P>
</B><P>The development of a Mars research base such as MARS-OZ in the Australian Outback will enable Mars-related technology such as rover vehicles, new spacesuit designs and communications systems to be tested in an Australian Mars analogue environment. MARS-OZ will be a platform for other MSA projects, such as the Starchaser Marsupial Rover vehicle, and MarsSkin spacesuit.</P>
<P>MARS-OZ will complement similar facilities constructed and operated by international chapters of the Mars Society in Utah, Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic, and, in 2003, Iceland. </P>
<P>In November 2001, after the Project Jarntimarra expedition by Australian scientists and engineers to the Red Centre, MSA selected the Lake Frome Plains to the east of Arkaroola, in the Northern Flinders Ranges, as the most suitable location for an Australian base and the preferred site for MARS-OZ.</P>
<P>The precise site in the Arkaroola region for MARS-OZ will be selected later in 2002, once funding is secured for the next stage of the project. MARS-OZ will have the distinction of being the only Mars analogue research facility built and operated by the Mars Society in the Southern Hemisphere.</P>

<B><P>Reasons for Selecting the Arkaroola site for MARS-OZ</P>
</B><P>The advantages of the Arkaroola site for MARS-OZ focus heavily on its existing research links, access by road and air, proximity to the Arkaroola resort and visual characteristics that are analogous to Mars, such as the red soil and dust.</P>
<P>Professor Malcolm Walter at Macquarie University and the Australian Centre for Astrobiology have been undertaking astrobiology research at Mt Painter in recent years. Thermal spring environments are well known for their rapid mineral deposition, making them particularly suitable for the preservation of a microbial fossil record. These factors make hydrothermal deposits excellent targets for looking for fossil evidence of Martian life. Extremophiles in Paralana Hot Springs in the Arkaroola district are currently being studied for their analogue value as examples of life that may have arisen or currently exist on Mars.</P>
<P>Any future research plan for the site can leverage off the existing Mars analogue research being carried out in the area. Mars hardware testing or integrated analogue simulation at the MARS-OZ site could incorporate this real field science to help us understand how future Mars surface crews may need to explore for microbial fossil evidence.</P>
<P>FIGURE 4 - Astrobiology Research in the Australian Outback.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/amec2002/proceedings/Image66.jpg" WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=378></P>
<P>The proposed site is also situated close to a tourist base with amenities and transport to and from Adelaide, the nearest capital city, which is eight hours drive away. In addition, there is a local airstrip.</P>
<P>The nearby Arkaroola tourist resort was established in the 1940’s, making it one of the first eco-tourism locations in Australia. It provides mainly nature-based activities to its guests such as bushwalking, photography and 4-wheel drive tours, and a range of accommodation options including camping sites, cabins and homesteads. Arkaroola has some ‘space’ associations of its own, aside from its selection as the site for MARS-OZ, with the largest privately-owned observatory in Australia, offering night viewing tours to guests.</P>
<P>Support from the Sprigg family, the founders of Arkaroola, and the availability of local services supported by a tourist market, provide a local base to help with MARS-OZ maintenance, security and land access issues.</P>
<B><P>The MARS-OZ concept</P>
</B><P>MARS-OZ will have the distinction of being the only Mars analogue research facility built and operated by the Mars Society in the Southern Hemisphere.</P>
<P>The centrepiece of MARS-OZ is the habitat or research base, a prototype of the type of structure people could live and work in on Mars. Unlike the other Mars Society research stations, it is a horizontal biconic rather than a vertical ‘tuna can’ design.</P>
<P>The proposed habitat consists of a cylinder 12 m long and 4.5 m in diameter with a 6-m long upswept nose cone (Clarke 2002). The structure will have two decks, each with 2.1-m headroom, and will stand on four legs, fitted with skids to allow limited repositioning, 1.0 m above the ground. The upper deck will be used for living and working space, while the lower deck will provide personal sleeping, washing, and toilet facilities.</P>
<P>The habitat itself is part of a larger complex; which will eventually include a simulated cargo lander, also of biconic design, inflatable structures and solar power systems.</P>
<P>FIGURE 5 - The MARS-OZ Concept (drawings by Jozef Michalek, Mars Society Australia)</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/amec2002/proceedings/Image67.jpg" WIDTH=504 HEIGHT=379></P>
<P>The MARS-OZ concept (Clarke 2002) proposes that honours students from universities would work on the bulk of research projects associated with MARS-OZ, whose work could, in turn, dovetail into work coordinated by their senior counterparts. A typical crew rotation on MARS-OZ would last 1-2 months and involve disciplines ranging from geology to information technology and communications and life support.</P>
<P>While MARS-OZ is not likely to end up a totally enclosed biosphere, recycling of water and waste will be an important element of the research program, and maximization of these opportunities will be a goal for the habitat.</P>
<B><P>Educational opportunities</P>
</B><P>Some Australian governments and educational institutions are starting to see linkage of educational programs with space activities as a way of fostering an interest and careers in science and technology. It brings science alive to students, and opens their eyes to its practical application across multiple disciplines.</P>
<P>For example, the Victorian Government's Science in Schools Strategy (DET 2002) provides a number of innovative opportunities for secondary school students to participate in the Science in Schools Strategy projects, including the Victorian Space Science Education Centre based at Strathmore Secondary College. This Centre will provide students with space science education, with facilities covering laboratories, a computer centre, a space habitat, auditorium, multi-purpose room, museum/display area, planetarium and telescope facility. This Centre will be available to schools, teachers and teachers-in-training for hands-on activity sessions, workshops, lectures and professional development activities.</P>
<P>Linking educational curricula and programs to MARS-OZ could allow primary and secondary students to study the work being undertaken in the Outback and provide a focus for school excursions and field trips. Students could observe astrobiology experiments and data gathering in the field, and use it as a springboard to the study of life in the Universe. Schools such as Lucas Heights Community School (Brown 2002) and North Sydney Girls High (Kumarich 2002) in Sydney are already teaching astrobiology in the classroom as a context for motivating students in science.</P>
<P>Partnerships with schools such as Knox Grammar School and Ravenswood School for Girls in Sydney, where students have built ground stations for telemetry and navigational data from a Russian microsatellite (Hughes 2002) or Forest Hill Secondary College in Melbourne, which has developed an innovative program in solar model cars, robotics and environmental science (Waugh 2002) could prove fruitful.</P>
<P>Undergraduate and postgraduate student could also use the design and operation of MARS-OZ as a focus for their work in theses and dissertations. Universities whose work currently plays a role in the MSA Technical Programme include RMIT University in Melbourne, and the University of Sydney. The Software Engineering Support Centre at RMIT University is researching an infrastructure and tools that will support the work of a small group of researchers and explorers on Mars (TAMER project), while undergraduate students at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Sydney have developed an analogue space helmet as an element of Project MarsSkin. There is scope for these types of projects to be broadened to encompass astrobiology research, such as further study of the Mt Painter hydrothermal system, or other disciplines such as geology, biology, physics and engineering. Some of these students or their supervisors may require an increment on MARS-OZ to complete their research.</P>
<B><P>Outreach opportunities</P>
</B><P>Media interest in the MARS-OZ concept has been high, with coverage in State and national newspapers, magazines, and radio. MARS-OZ could capitalise on the recent headlines about the discovery of sub-surface water on Mars and speculation on the timeframe of sending humans to the Red Planet, to promote astrobiology as a field that is ripe with possibilities for finding life on Mars.</P>
<P>TV and video films, including documentaries, shot on location at MARS-OZ, are flagged as possible ways to raise revenue and improve the public’s understanding about Mars analogue research and exploration. The Discovery Channel has been a major sponsor of the Devon Island research base, regularly filming life and work on the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station.</P>
<P>Webcasts and videolinks with crew members working and living on MARS-OZ could raise the profile of science and technology generally among the public. This kind of media or outreach event mimics those which are currently being provided by crews on the International Space Station and will thus assist in the analogue value of a stay on MARS-OZ. These ‘virtual reality’ tours or interviews are also less intrusive for crews and better able to be controlled and managed than face-to-face visits, providing more realistic simulation opportunities.</P>
<P>Once constructed and prior to deployment, MARS-OZ could travel the country as the centrepiece of a Mars educational exhibition. There is also potential to mount these travelling roadshows during the off-season, assuming that the facility is not required in situ for tourism purposes. This would be analogous to the exhibit of the Mars Desert Research Station, before its first field season, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and plans to display the European Mars Society’s E-Mars facility at the Chicago Planetarium before it is moved to Iceland. MARS-OZ has the advantage of being more mobile than these other research facilities, as it will be designed to be transported "anywhere in Australia as a single unit with self-escort and some route selection." (Clarke 2002)</P>
<B><P>Terrestrial space tourism</P>
</B><P>Terrestrial space tourism appears to be growing, satisfying at least some of the dreams of people fascinated by space (David 2001). This could represent a niche area for Australian tourism (Laing &amp; Crouch 2002) in the future, building on Australia’s experience and history as a past and future launch site. It has also been recently announced that a U.K. aerospace company, Starchaser Industries, the major sponsor of Project Jarntimarra, wishes to develop and test a sub-orbital vehicle for space travel, and plans to operate space flights from Woomera, South Australia.</P>
<P>According to Professor Geoffrey Crouch, Chair of Tourism Marketing at La Trobe University (Laing 2001), the definition of ‘space tourism’ is often considered too narrowly:</P>
<P>"The media interest is largely focused on civilians going on spaceflights, but let's not forget that people have been participating in space-related tourism activities for years … Tourists regularly attend Shuttle and rocket launches at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and visit planetariums and space museums. In fact the Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington is the most visited museum in the world. A company called LunaCorp is planning to place a robotic vehicle on the Moon, which would allow people on Earth to make a simulated 'trip' to the lunar surface. For some time now, the Russians have been taking tourists on MiG flights and zero-G flights aboard the Ilyushin-76 cosmonaut training aircraft. These are all examples of activities which can be validly captured under the banner of space tourism."</P>
<P>Professor Crouch and his colleague at the University of Technology in Sydney, Professor Jordan Louviere, break the space tourism market down into the following categories (David 2001):</P>

<UL>
<LI>Space-lite: Camps, theme parks and other activities whereby the public obtain a simulated space experience without ever leaving the Earth’s surface; </LI>
<LI>Space-lite plus: Actual near-space experiences, such as flights that permit a person to experience short periods of microgravity, or take very high-altitude supersonic "joy rides" and sightseeing trips; </LI>
<LI>Space-medium: Actual suborbital experiences lasting for brief periods and/or very low orbit experiences lasting one or at most two to three days; </LI>
<LI>Space-heavy: Actual orbital experiences lasting several days that might include accompanying "official" crews on missions, a residential stay in a space station, or more serious efforts that include specially-built orbiting hotels.</LI></UL>

<B><P>Tourism opportunities</P>
</B><P>Tourism activities at MARS-OZ would fall into the category of "space-lite." Tourists visiting the Arkaroola area could be taken to see the MARS-OZ site from a distance as a local attraction and provided with a simple overview of the research being undertaken there, including testing of equipment and technology in the field. Turning MARS-OZ into a tourist attraction may require infrastructure such as transport hubs, toilets, kiosks, a viewing area and possibly even souvenir shops, part of the ‘zone of closure,’ which Gunn (1985) sees as " a necessary part of a well-planned tourist attraction." (Pearce, P., Benckendorff, P. &amp; Johnstone, S. in Faulkner 2000).</P>
<P>Interior visits and close-up views of the base could be managed on a less frequent basis, to prevent undue disruption to work and the breaking of simulations. Virtual reality (VR), using a camera to view inside MARS-OZ, might be considered as a way of providing access to the base from a visitors’ viewing area, without unduly disrupting the work going on. This would require infrastructure to be set up, such as a visitors’ centre and viewing area. It might also be possible to provide visitors with a ‘bird’s-eye view’ of a simulated extra-vehicular activity (EVA) or ‘spacewalk’ through the helmet, so that the observer has the sensation of seeing what the ‘astronaut’ would see. A more detailed inspection of MARS-OZ and even use of the facility by tourists could then be limited to the off-season, as discussed below.</P>
<P>Combining space tourism and VR is not a new concept. LunaCorp in the United States is looking at using virtual reality for commercial and tourism purposes when it sends its Icebreaker Moon Rover to the Moon in late 2003 (LunaCorp 2002). The idea is that people would watch its progress on the Moon live on the Internet, on television networks and at science centres. As well as online opportunities, their plan covers television and films, theme park rights and merchandise such as toys, clothing and posters. "Follow-on rovers will be sent on a Grand Apollo Tour of historic lunarsites." Space Dev, another U.S. corporation, are also working on a Lunar Orbiter project. The business plan for this project is focused on the worldwide media applications of the live HDTV streaming video from the Moon.</P>
<P>Privacy issues are relevant to filming humans on MARS-OZ. Scientists using the base will be there first and foremost to carry out their research. There is a serious question to ask as to whether they would want an intrusive camera on them around the clock or even for limited periods of time. Scientists might see this scenario as a stunt along the lines of the TV show <I>Big Brother </I>and bypass MARS-OZ for a more anonymous base for their work, especially if they consider that the intrusion might jeopardise the validity of their work. For example, human factors experiments might be compromised if people know they are being filmed, as they may talk or act differently than they otherwise would if the camera were not there. On the other hand, these activities might have a valuable role to play in public outreach and education programs, as well as stimulating the local economy through tourism. Sponsorship or visitor dollars might also flow through to fund extended research programs and provide money for grants and scholarships.</P>
<P>Tourists staying on MARS-OZ for limited periods of time would be able to experience what it might be like to live on a Mars base. This type of activity would also need to be carefully managed to avoid disrupting the work on MARS-OZ. Like the VR concepts outlined in this paper, it could be a means of funding some of the research projects, as well as being a source of public education about Mars exploration, science and technology.</P>
<P>Thought needs to be given to a balance of structured and unstructured activities, as recent analyses have suggested that there has been "a fundamental shift in the nature of tourism away from a mass production industry providing standardized holiday packages towards greater individuality, independence, more flexible itineraries and greater variety in the experiences desired and sought." (Moscardo, G., Faulkner, B. &amp; Laws, E. in Faulkner 2000).</P>
<P>Building on the growth in eco-tourism or nature-based tourism (Lawton L. &amp; Weaver, D. in Faulkner 2000) and a greater interest in limiting damage to the environment might also be useful in planning tourism in the area. Visits to MARS-OZ could have an educational element focusing on environmental issues such as recycling of water and waste minimisation.</P>
<B><P>Project Leto</P>
</B><P>The Mars Society’s Mars Analogue Research Stations have their counterpart in the Moon Society’s Project Leto.</P>
<P>The Moon Society is a non-profit educational and scientific foundation formed to further scientific study and development of the Moon. Project Leto (Lunar Exploration Base Simulation) is the first major project for the Moon Society, involving the construction of a full-scale simulation of an initial lunar exploration base. Leto will be marketed for outreach purposes, analogue research, and as a tourist destination (Moon Society 2002). </P>
<P>Funding is still being solicited for the project. The initial site will likely be located in Las Vegas, to capitalise on the large tourist industry already established in the area. The aim is for Project Leto to encompass activities at many sites, including locations in Hesperia, California and Hawaii. Other locations being considered by the Moon Society are Arizona, Florida, and New Mexico.</P>
<P>MARS-OZ and Project Leto might be able to offer live feeds to the other’s base and share ideas and initiatives, given the similarity of their missions. Scientists and engineers might wish to use each other’s facilities in reciprocal arrangements designed to strengthen research links across the globe.</P>
<B><P>Future Steps</P>
</B><P>Entering into partnership and cooperative arrangements with educational institutions or tourism bureaux, tourism operators, the Arkaroola resort owners and landowners, will need to be set up if MARS-OZ is to be accessible to the general public and to reach its educational, outreach and tourism potential, as well as being the hub for Australian Mars analogue research. International scientists and engineers paying to use the facilities at MARS-OZ might partly fund educational programs and government grants could be applied for in the areas of education and tourism.</P>
<P>A detailed plan, complete with costings, needs to be put together for MARS-OZ, covering educational, outreach and tourism opportunities, along the lines of the scientific plan that will be prepared by the MARS-OZ project team.</P>
<B><P>Conclusion</P>
</B><P>Australia’s red, rocky terrain and wide-open spaces have proved attractive to researchers who want to recreate part of Mars on our own planet. Mars Society Australia have located a site for a semi-permanent Mars analogue research base which will complement other bases constructed by the Mars Society around the world, all currently in the Northern Hemisphere. </P>
<P>The Australian Mars Analogue Research Station (MARS-OZ) offers a variety of opportunities for education and public outreach about science and technology, using space as the ‘hook.’ It also provides tourism benefits in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, if this is managed and controlled appropriately.</P>
<P>Funding for MARS-OZ, whether public or private, and partnerships with a variety of organisations, including educational institutions and tourism operatives, and a detailed plan, will be necessary to make these opportunities available and to maximise the potential of the site.</P>
