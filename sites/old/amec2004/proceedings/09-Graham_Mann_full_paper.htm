<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Project Overview</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Marsupial Project was created when MSA founding member Jason Hoogland of the University of Queensland won a US$10,000 Mars Society Rover Initiative grant in 2000. But the project suffered something of a false start when the Queensland group began to design and build their Marsupial machine (nicknamed HOP). In retrospect, their decision to base the machine around a 4WD Mitsubishi van was not a good one, because i) the vehicle they designed was too small for the purpose and ii) the used base vehicle they chose was not mechanically sound. When the project was transferred to new management in Western Australia in February 2002, these issues forced the Mitsubishi vehicle and its associated plans to be scrapped. Although the Queensland team had won the contract and in proposed some good design ideas (some of which have been preserved in the current incarnation) the result was almost 18 months and nearly $7,500 wasted. The lessons to be drawn from this experience are only the general rules that good engineering begins with careful specification of the requirements, and that good purchasing requires objective assessment of the condition and capabilities of the equipment.</P>
<P>The project was restarted by the WA team in March, 2002. The primary difficulty was the budget. With the money remaining, a suitable functional 4WD base vehicle (such as an Oka) could not be purchased. Therefore, the decision was taken to purchase a base vehicle chassis only. Because that would involve much more construction work, this was not an ideal solution, but was taken because i) the MSA Board was anxious to begin construction and ii) it offered the chance to purpose-build a unique vehicle, ideally suited to the MSA requirements. After review of the specifications and consideration of a number of options, a low-cost Series II forward-control (FC) Landrover chassis was purchased. Such vehicles are rugged 4WD machines, with reliable and well-understood Landrover mechanical systems, and are frequently modified for use in off- road, military applications. The used FC vehicle had a dysfunctional engine, but it was old and underpowered and would have required replacement even if operational. A more powerful 3 litre diesel 4WD engine was donated to the project, but this has required some modification to be used in the Landrover chassis.</P>

</I></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some compromises to an ideal Mars-capable machine have proven necessary. To avoid the expense and logistical difficulty of transporting the vehicle large distances to test sites by truck, it is highly desirable to design the vehicle in such a way that it can be licensed to travel under its own power on public roads. This means that the body, engine, transmission, steering, brakes, wheels, lights, windscreen and wipers must be sound enough to pass a roadworthiness test in the "experimental vehicle" class. Although meeting certification requirements imposes severe design constraints, the base vehicle is currently licensed and it is clear that fully restoring its actual roadworthiness will greatly expand the value of the vehicle to the MSA</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For management and funding purposes the construction is divided into three phases:</P>
<B><P>Stage 1- Base vehicle refit. </B>This work is conducted by engineer contracted by the MSA. The base vehicle is acquired, assessed, refurbished and, were necessary, modified to make it a safe, roadworthy and reliable 4WD vehicle around which the rover will be formed. This requires disassembly, inspection and refurbishment of the suspension, brakes, engine, gearbox, transmission and control linkages. Where necessary worn parts are replaced in a routine overhaul. The existing engine is replaced by more modern 3L diesel engine. The heater/ airconditioner is installed. Extra fuel and water tanks are fitted. The tyres are replaced, while the spare is relocated for the new configuration. The electrical system is reworked. New headlamps, trafficators, stoplights, license plates and mirrors are provided. Modern 4WD bucket seats with seatbelts to suitable hardpoints are fitted. The vehicle is generally restored to certifiable roadworthy condition. Stage 1 is 100% funded.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Stage 2- Design and fabrication of body. </B></FONT>The design work on the body commenced during Stage 1 is finalised and detailed construction prints are extracted to simplify the fabrication process as much as possible. Steel fabrication is performed by a licensed motor body builder. A plastic-forming contractor is hired to supply certain components. Forward canopy is built up around standard shatterproof windscreen glass to certification standard. Non-slip flooring is installed. Doors and fold-down stepladder are constructed and installed. Because it is mostly done by contractors, this stage is likely to be both faster and considerably more expensive than Stage 1. Stage 2 is 100% funded.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Stage 3- Interior Fitout.</FONT> </B>Remaining interior fitout is completed. This consists of mid-cabin compartments such as the spacesuit lockers, safety seats for rear passengers, interior lighting units. The rear section module, for use only with in the fully covered option, comprises twin bunks, a fold down bed, a portable sink unit and a private cubicle containing a portable cassette toilet. Essentially, the vehicle is to be fitted out as a fully self-contained camper van for outback travel. Most of this work is expected to be completed by recreational vehicle contractors, but part may be completed by volunteers. The vehicle may be useable for some experiments or promotional work before Stage 3 is fully complete. An exact budget for Stage 3 has yet to finalised.</P>
<P>The MSA considers the vehicle to be an integral part of Operation Red Centre, which will field test the Mars-Oz habitat [<A HREF="#One">1</A>], the MarsSkin suit [<A HREF="#Two">2</A>] and the Starchaser Marsupial Rover [<A HREF="#Three">3</A>] in central Australia.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Successes and Problems</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the following, first project success, then three classes of problems, along with suggested solutions, are briefly outlined, with a view to both better understanding the project work, and to allow future project managers to benefit from this experience.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good design base.</FONT> </B>A great deal of effort has gone into the design phase of the project. The chief engineer, Bruce Armstrong, was contracted to do detailed CAD drawings of the chassis modifications and of the cabin and body. The design is specifically optimised for cost, weight and ease of manufacture. The output from this design process is highly detailed construction plans, which very much aids the contract builders. At the time of writing, almost all the design process is complete. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One good design idea held over from the original HOP concept is that of a removable rear pressurised module, which converts the vehicle into a flatbed truck. This would allow the analogue rover to provide transport of equipment, luggage, storage tanks etc. to service the Mars-Oz habitat. It could also serve another purpose. Robert Zubrin [<A HREF="#Four">4</A>] suggested that the first task for the (automated) pressurised rover on arrival would be to drive off the lander and set up a small nuclear reactor for power. The Starchaser rover could be used to simulate (or visualise for the media) this task. A mockup reactor would be hoisted off the flatbed using the robot arm (see Fig. 2) or a built-in HIAB crane [<A HREF="#Five">5</A>]. The concept is that the rover would be delivered to the Martian surface in the flatbed configuration, with the reactor already loaded for robotic deployment. After the crew arrived, they would reconfigure the rover as a fully enclosed vehicle for surface travel by mounting the rear pressurised cabin. </P>
<B><P>Navigation/Instrumentation Software. </B>Consulting engineer Peter Edwards has begun building a suite of software designed to serve the need for modern instrumentation. The navigational and display core of this software has already been tested in field application (harbour dredging) and performed reliably. It is envisaged that the software will simply monitor, rather than command, the system hardware. This choice is made because one does not wish to lose control of the rover systems if the software fails. The software is likely to be deployed on built in IBM-type PC tablets built into the forward cabin consoles. Care must be taken with such displays that they are bright and visually clear enough for operation in less than ideal lighting. Further development of the package will continue in parallel with the construction of the rover hardware.</P>

<I><FONT SIZE=2><P>Figure 2. The Starchaser rover in flat-bed configuration carries a mockup power supply off the Mars-Oz landing vehicle ready for "deployment" near the habitat. In the absence of a functional robot arm, the power supply could be lifted off with a small HIAB crane.</P>
</I><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Related Field Trials.</FONT> </B>The worth of any such analogue project is measured by the scientific and technical information it yields. Project Marsupial has launched an active research program, even before its principal machine is built. Ex-One saw the world's first comparative field trials on analogue Mars rovers of different designs under realistic simulation conditions [<A HREF="#Six">6</A>]. The University of Michigan's Everest rover, the Mars Society of Canada's ARES rover, and an unmodified Nissan Pathfinder called Aonia were all field tested at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah. A human factors experiment, in which the same crew of three executed the same simulated science mission in each of the three vehicles, yielded comparative data on the capacity of each vehicle to safely and comfortably carry explorers away from the main base, enter and exit the vehicle in spacesuits, perform science tasks in the field, and manage geological and biological samples. The results have been made available to the designers, in the hope of improving future rovers. </P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Base of Operations. </B></FONT>Project Marsupial and other work being done by the MSA has inspired the science masters of a local Catholic boys school, Trinity College, to offer their premises as a base of operations and housing for the rover when in Perth. The school has offered to construct a special building for rover work, and has very well equipped workshops for technical manufacturing purposes, as well as pool of experts who are willing to help with the project. At present the building plans are progressing through various local government planning regulations, and construction should begin this year.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Technical and Design Problems</FONT>.</B> One issue is that of narrowness of wheelbase. The vehicle body needs to be 2200mm wide, yet the wheels are only 1400mm apart. This means some body overhang with its attendant risk of roll instability, though due to the low centre of gravity, not to a serious degree. Wider wheel centres would be desirable, but would involve extensive and time-consuming modifications to the axles, which at this stage is not being contemplated.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/amec2004/proceedings/Image48.jpg" WIDTH=436 HEIGHT=327></P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2><P>Figure 3. One-eighth scale model shows the basic shape of the plastic body, which is highly constrained by both practical and licensing restrictions for road worthiness.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> The v</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>ertical slot on the right represents a storage bay for the putative robot arm.</P>
</I></FONT><P>Another problem has been the design of the forward cabin, particularly with regard to transparencies. Ideally, a Mars reconnaissance vehicle should have maximum transparency for observations and photography, a consideration reinforced during the Ex-One rover trials, during which the science team indicated the desire for "all-round visibility". From an engineering point of view, on the other hand, a pressurised cabin should have as few windows as possible, in order to minimise the risk of leaks. The dilemma is similar to that faced by the designers of passenger aircraft: engineers might wish to avoid perforating the cabin with multiple holes, yet the airlines cannot sell seats without windows. In the case of the Starchaser rover, the situation is further complicated by other competing requirements. Since the vehicle will be operating in desert regions of Australia, the amount of light and heat admitted to the forward cabin should be minimised. Furthermore, licensing requirements specify a laminated windscreen with wipers, which practically forces the use of a standard truck windscreen. Yet it is also important for the purposes of publicity and visual appeal that the rover look the part of a futuristic Mars vehicle, which calls for a more striking body shape than that of a contemporary cargo van. A possible resolution would be to make clever use of paint: if the windscreen was tinted gold, the illusion of transparency might be extended to the roof by using a matching colour on the (opaque) plastic surface. Similarly, while larger diameter, outboard spring wheels might more closely resemble the actual flight hardware, these are disallowed under road rules. For the purposes of photography and off the highway, realistic free-running spring wheels could perhaps be fitted to the sides of the vehicles, mostly obscuring the real wheels, at least for the purposes of press photography.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final design problem is that of the robot arm, which was always part of the design. First, a low-cost (&gt;$40,000) design for this subsystem has been completed by the chief engineer, but so far funding for this has not been secured. Second, the placement of this device has involved considerable argument. The design of automated or teleoperated devices such as deep-sea submersibles [eg 7] suggests that optimal placement for manipulators is at the front end of a vehicle, where work surfaces are directly encountered and where cameras, sensors etc. are already aimed. On the other hand, a forward-mounted robot arm would be vulnerable to collisions and would not reach into the tray part of the vehicle in the flat-bed configuration. The current design favours local human teleoperation and stows the arm in a vertical compartment at the rear of the mid cabin. A control station for the arm is located inside the mid cabin, with windows to the side and rear, so that the whole configuration is similar to that of the Canada arm on the Space Shuttle. </P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Financial Problems.</B></FONT> A serious cashflow issue has caused some problems for the project. In 2003, a major sponsor donated $41,000, the amount required to fund Stage 2. Before the money was made available to the project, the MSA incurred other debts which had to be repaid, and had insufficient funds to cover them. Approximately half of the donation was used to cover these debts, with the promise that it would be repaid as soon as possible. So far this money has not been forthcoming and this has led to a shortfall of approximately $18,000 for Stage 2 of the project. A second sponsor subsequently withdrew from the project, stating that until this shortfall was repaid, he would make no more contributions to the project. The lesson here is that money earmarked for particular projects should always be transparently expended on those projects alone, for fear of creating doubts in the minds of all sponsors. However, given that MSA has operational overheads, and that sponsors tend to want to put money into the more conspicuous science projects only, the rule that in future 10% of donations be levied by the general account it is reasonable, which together with rigourous accounting by project managers should avoid any such problem in future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second financial problem is of a more general variety and is important in that it affects other MSA projects besides Marsupial. It is a mistake not to have secured clear tax concession status for MSA. It is likely that that the work done by the MSA could help qualify a sponsor for the Federal Government's Research &amp; Development Tax Concession under Section 73B of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The MSA would need to apply to become a Registered Research Agency [<A HREF="#EIght">8</A>]. This would need to be accompanied by written authorisation from the Australian Taxation Office. There may be other ways of securing a tax concession. It is impossible to estimate how many of the refusals from sponsors approached so far have been as a result of uncertainty about this issue, but commonsense suggests that a generous tax concession is something for fundraisers to bargain with, and may even attract sponsors who have no special interest in Mars analogue research.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Management Problems.</B></FONT> Next to finance, the most serious problem is labour. Although there is considerable interest in the project and many people have indicated a willingness to help in one way or another, the core WA team is in fact tiny, and work parties usually consist of only one or two persons. Even these team members have full-time jobs and many other commitments which limit the time they can put in to the project. For this reason, work on the project is extremely slow. The orthodox notion that such a complex project could be completed by volunteer labour has certainly proven impractical, if the project is to be completed in any reasonable time frame. One solution is to hire contractors. This has in fact been the rule for the last eight months of Project Marsupial, but the current 1-2 contractors will need to be expanded if future deadlines are to be met (see below). Even with contractors, at the rates the project can afford to pay, the Starchaser rover is often held off while other, better-paid contracts are completed. The recent local boom in railway work has proven particularly problematic in this regard, with both the chief engineer and the body-building contractor being called away to do urgent upgrades to stations and rolling stock within the last six months. It is a project manager's responsibility to work with the contractors to set realistic deadlines for completed work, and hold the contractors to them. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These workforce problems stem from the financial constraints on the project, not from the level of skill required for this project, which does not exceed local competence; contractors to build every part of the project could certainly be found in Perth. The problem is that the rates of payment available in the budget do not retain many committed specialists for the project. At "mates rates", progress at commercial rates cannot be expected. One valuable source of technical competence at low cost comes from an unexpected quarter: the ageing demographic. The project has inspired a good number of highly technically skilled, time-rich retirees have pledged support to the project. It has on occasion literally been possible to place plans for some component into the hands of these individuals, and fetch the completed work, free of charge, in a few days.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to get the best value out of volunteers - and paid contractors - it is a good idea to divide project work up into clearly delineated, modular work units. "Project boxes", consisting of plans, physical parts and/or notes on construction should be made available to one (or even several parallel) contracted individual so that what is expected of them is clear, and so that they have a definite sense of accomplishment when the task is completed. This requires some extra work on the part of the project manager, however. The overall construction effort must be analysed into fairly independent subunits, and it takes some effort to produce plans which are detailed enough to be useful to workers who have not been with the project from the start. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Future Prospects</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first field test for the rover should be a continuation of the rover comparisons carried out at MDRS. If the construction problems can be overcome, this might be accomplished as early as next year, in South Australia, at a location geomorphically similar to the Lith Canyon site in Utah. Ideally, the same crew would also be used for this test. In May, 2005, Starchaser Industries plans to launch its first man-rated spacecraft from Woomera. It would be very appropriate to have the Starchaser Rover there as part of what will undoubtedly be a high-profile media event. In the longer term, the machine should be permanently based at the Mars-Oz habitat, where it must be readied to commence a challenging set of test operations, as outlined in Mann [<A HREF="#Three"><FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT></A>].<FONT SIZE=2> </P>
