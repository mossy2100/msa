Spaceward
                Bound is an educational program developed at NASA Ames Research
                Center in California.The mission of Spaceward Bound is to train
                the next generation of space explorers by having students and
                teachers participate in the exploration of scientifically interesting
                but remote and extreme environments on Earth as analogs for human
                exploration of the Moon and Mars. These natural environments
                pose significant challenges and opportunities for human explorers.<br><br>

The next generation of space explorers (those
                currently in elementary and middle school) needs to understand
                how to establish and maintain scientific outposts in harsh environments.
                They must be trained to live and work in these environments and
                learn how to explore the surfaces of these worlds.<br><br>

The Spaceward Bound Field Expeditions
                involve teachers in authentic scientific fieldwork so that they
                can bring that experience back to their classrooms and assist
                in the development of curriculum related to human exploration
                of remote and extreme environments.<br><br>

See <a href="http://quest.nasa.gov/projects/spacewardbound" target="_blank">http://quest.nasa.gov/projects/spacewardbound</a> for more information.<br><br>


The NASA Spaceward Bound Program will be conducting an expedition
                to the Arkaroola Region of South Australia during July 2009.&nbsp; The
                purpose of the expedition will be to explore the following topics
                of astrobiological interest:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Hypolithic algae</li>
                <li>Soil bacateria</li>

                <li>Thermal springs</li>
                <li>Remote sensing of underground features</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The leader of the expedition will be Dr. Christopher P. McKay,
                PI of the Spaceward Bound Program<br>
