Twenty-four year old aerospace engineer Michael West is heading to Jindabyne
and the surrounding areas this week as the Snowy River region�s Australia
Day Ambassador for 2008. Thanks to the generous support of Woolworths,
Michael will join more than 160 high achieving Australians who will be
giving up their time to share their experiences and their national pride
with communities across New South Wales on 26 January this year.<br><br>

Michael was a NSW finalist in the 2006 Young Australian of the Year Awards
and is currently undertaking PhD studies at the Australian National
University in Canberra. Originally from Sydney, Michael completed degrees in
Aerospace Engineering and Science, majoring in Physics and Geophysics, at
the University of Sydney and has been involved in various space projects in
Australia.<br><br>

In 2001, he joined a team of Australian researchers and NASA experts who
investigated Mars-like sites in outback Australia where a Mars simulation
facility is being established to assist with astronaut training in the
future. Michael has designed, constructed and tested two different
experiments that have been launched aboard surface to air missiles from the
Woomera Rocket Range and worked as an intern in 2005 at the SETI Institute
in California.<br><br>

Michael is currently working on developing next generation plasma propulsion
systems for spacecraft and, in particular, the Helicon Double Layer
Thruster. Such technology may one day propel human beings to the Moon, Mars
and beyond. He has also worked on the Phobos Reconnaissance & International
Mars Exploration (PRIME) Mission - a Canadian Space Agency funded concept
study for a robotic mission to Mars� innermost moon, Phobos.

2008 is Michael West�s third year as an Australia Day Ambassador and he is
looking forward to the opportunity to speak about Australia�s involvement in
space engineering endeavours, past, present and future. �Most people aren�t
aware that Australia was a key player in the early years of the space era
and was the fourth country in the world to launch a satellite from its own
territory� explains Mr West. The satellite, called WRESAT, was launched from
the Woomera Rocket Range in 1967 and was built in less than a year and
orbited the Earth 624 times, an extraordinary achievement for the time.<br><br>

�The achievements of the scientists and engineers who worked at Woomera are
truly remarkable and, just like the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme,
are an important symbol of Australia�s identity as an independent and
resourceful country. These grand endeavours are why we are known
internationally as the ?Clever Country�, but that mantle is slipping. I hope
that I can inspire young Australians in particular to consider a career in a
science or engineering field and encourage them to help put Australia back
up there with the best in the world.� said Mr West.<br><br>

Mr West will visit the towns of Jindabyne, Berridale, Adaminaby and Dalgetty
and participate in the official festivities including delivering the
Australia Day Address. �Visiting these communities is a real privilege and a
great opportunity to share with other Australians about the many things that
we can be proud of as a nation. Australia is a fantastic place to live and
we have much to celebrate.� said Mr West.<br><br>
