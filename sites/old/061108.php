He graduated as a palaeontologist, moved into petroleum and coal geology, and completed his PhD in carbonate sedimentology and palaeoecology. Dr. Clarke has worked on marine surveys in the Southern and Indian Oceans, explored for base metals, nickel, copper and gold throughout Australia, the Philippines and Chile. Dr. Clarkes research interests include terrestrial analogues of Martian landscapes and developing exploration strategies for human missions to Mars. He has participated in Mars analogue field work in deserts in Utah, USA and in South Australia, the later as the science leader of Mars Society Australias Jarntimarra expedition in 2001. Dr. Clarke is an Associate Member of the Australian Centre for Astrobiology and the vice president and research committee chair of Mars Society Australia.
