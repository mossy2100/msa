To succeed, such missions will depend not only a great deal of scientific and technological know-how, but also on a new kind of spacefaring society - one able to bridge the gulf between worlds: a two-planet culture. To this end, in addition to scientists and technologists, I extend our invitation to the social experts, managers, writers and artists who will be instrumental in forging such a culture.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Since 2001, the AMEC conferences have been an international forum for Mars exploration. Past AMEC guests have included speakers such as Apollo 17 geologist Dr. Harrison Schmidt, space simulation expert Dr. Vadim Gushin of the Moscow Institute of Biomedical Problems and Dr. Steven Squires, Principle Investigator of NASA&#39;s Mars Exploration Rover team.&nbsp; AMEC conferences are run by the Mars Society Australia, an incorporated, non-profit research body that does practical research in support of an eventual human mission to Mars. MSA is affiliated with the worldwide Mars Society which has about 6,000 members.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Call for Papers Now Open</h2><p><span>The call for papers for AMEC2012 is now open.&nbsp; Find out more (including detailed instruction for presenters) by reading the full&nbsp;<a href="http://marssociety.org.au/event/amec-2012/call-for-papers">call for papers notice</a>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><h2>Friday Night Public Lecture</h2><p><span>A public lecture will be held on the evening of Friday 14th September.&nbsp; (Details of this event, including the venue, speaker and title will be announced).&nbsp; Entry will be via a voluntary gold coin donation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Registration Process</h2><p><span>Registering for AMEC2012 online is a 2-step process.</span></p><ol style="list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial;     "><li><span>Create a user account for this website if you do not already have one, using our&nbsp;<a href="http://marssociety.org.au/user/register">website registration page</a>&nbsp;and log into your new account.&nbsp; If you are an existing Mars Society Australia member, log into your existing members account.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Once you have logged in, proceed to our&nbsp;<a href="http://marssociety.org.au/event/amec-2012/registration">online registration page</a>.&nbsp; This will allow you to register and pay online both for AMEC, and the conference banquet.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Further Information</h2><p><span>The convenor of AMEC2012 is Dr Jonathan Clarke.&nbsp; Any queries regarding the conference should be directed to Jonathan at vicepresident(at)marssociety.org.au.
