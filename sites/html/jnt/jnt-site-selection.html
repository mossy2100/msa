<h2 id="jarntimarra">Jarntimarra-1</h2>

<p>The Jarntimarra-1 expedition was undertaken to visit, evaluate and rank Australian Mars analogue sites for possible
  use by the MSA for future field reseach activities such as testing the <a href="/project/marsupial">Marsupial</a>
  analogue rover and possible future deployment of an Australian analogue research station (<a href="/project/mars-oz">MARS-Oz</a>).</p>

<p>Australia is rich in locations geologists have identified as closely analogous Mars to environments observed on the
  surface of Mars. Initial electronic discussion between MSA members identified many of these, with further research
  identifying further sites of interest. Sites were nominated on the basis of scientific interest, the range of types of
  environments in the vicinity suitable for testing equipment, and visual resemblance to Mars. The most attractive sites
  were in central Australia, and most could be visited in a single 4WD trek.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluating the sites</h2>

<p>The Jarntimarra-1 expedition spent two weeks in the field and visited a wide range of sites. These are listed in
  <i>Table 1</i>. The expedition route is shown in <i>Figure 1</i>. In undertaking this expedition, every effort was made
  to obtain permission from the stakeholders, owners or custodians of the selected land before the visit took place,
  though in all cases the visits were non-intrusive. A paper detailing the expedition and site selection process is in
  press.</p>

<p>At each site the survey crew filled in a database information sheet. This was a set of 13 prompts for each field in
  the database: name, date, latitude/longitude, ownership, access, risks, maps, geology, climate, flora/fauna, history,
  analogue value and references. These provided for factual entries in the Jarntimarra database. To record comparative
  judgements with respect to the MSA&apos;s specific needs there was a separate assessment sheet with a list of 9
  scientific and 8 engineering criteria, favouring sites that have intrinsic scientific value and offering a range of
  conditions in which to test analogue vehicles, spacesuits and other equipment. There was also a set of 7 logistical
  criteria relating to the distance from facilities and practical difficulty of operations and 8 visual criteria,
  reflecting the public relations requirement for the site to photograph as if it were the Martian surface (<i>Table
    2</i>).</p>

<h2 id="selection">Selecting the regions</h2>

<p>A number of key issues for MSA were resolved during a three-day conference at Arkaroola village at the end of
  Jarntimarra-1. The expedition found that most of the assessed sites fell within the boundaries of only six 200-km
  diameter circles (<i>Figure 2</i>). The significance of these exploration zones is that each specifies a set of features
  within easy reach of one simulated Mars mission, given a vehicle capable of extended traverses. If the centre of a
  circle represents a habitat landing site, all the features within that zone would be accessible by sorties of no more
  than 100km. Each of these six centres represents a possible &quot;landing site&quot; for MARS-Oz.</p>

<p class='figure'><img src="/sites/default/files/images/jnt/6_circles_294_332.jpg"><br>
  <i>Figure 2 - The six prime regions selected during Jarntimarra-1</i></p>

<p>Based on the collective experience gained while filling in the site assessment sheets, each zone was rated on
  5-point scale according to the above specific characteristics. Engineering and science scores then were doubled to
  reflect their importance relative to the other criteria in the total score. On this basis, the Moon Plain, Woomera and
  Arkaroola zones achieved equal ranking.</p>

<p>To support the goal of recommending a premier site for the 2002-2003 season, the tie was broken by considering the
  arguments of individual expedition members advocating each zone. Eventually the case for the Arkaroola region prevailed
  by virtue of its unique combination of logistical convenience (hospitable base at nearby Arkaroola village; 8 hours road
  travel from Adelaide; 1200m all-weather airstrip at Balcanoona), international scientific reputation and Mars-like
  geology.</p>

<p>Specific Mars analogue research in the region has been three-fold, focusing on aeolian landforms, extremophiles, and
  remote sensing. Studies of aeolian landforms compared Martian dunes at Nili Petra with terrestrial dunes at Gurra Gurra
  Waterhole in the Strzelecki Desert. The extremophile work found radiation-resistant thermophiles in the Paralana hot
  spring which is characterised by high levels of radon gas. The area has been used in remote sensing experiments
  comparing hyperspectral imagery from the alteration halo surrounding the Mount Painter fossil hydrothermal system with
  ground truth from a hand-held spectrometer. This last study is particularly relevant to detecting the presence of such
  systems on Mars, which are believed to be good localities to search for microfossils. Potential Mars analogue geoscience
  research in the area may include palaeontology, geomorphology and regolith studies. The Proterozoic sediments of the
  area are known to host silicified microfossils and the sinters of the Mt. Gee fossil hydrothermal system show potential
  for microfossil preservation. Geomorphological and regolith studies include evolution of the alluvial fans on the
  eastern flank of the Flinders Ranges, nature of mound springs of Lake Frome, and landscape evolution of the northern
  Flinders Ranges, where uplift has led to partial exhumation and dissection of ancient land surfaces buried beneath
  Cretaceous cover.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The Jarntimarra-1 expedition examined a wide range of sites across South Australia and the Northern Territory. Many
  sites were identified which had value as useful Mars analogues.</p>

<p>The preferred site for the proposed Australian analogue research station was on the gravel plains to the east of the
  Arkaroola zone&apos;s central point, between the eastern side of the northern Flinders Ranges and Lake Frome. This was
  chosen for a number of reasons. It will allow easy access to sites in the Flinders Ranges proper and on the plains that
  surround Lake Frome. There are many different terrains and areas of extremely high scientific interest in the vicinity.
  It will also simplify logistics, as a well-maintained, unsealed road runs up the eastern margin of the ranges, joining
  the Strzelecki Track to the north and the Barrier Highway to the south. The exact co-ordinates of the Hab site will be
  decided upon during a further expedition after discussion with relevant land holders.</p>
