<p>This database is a catalogue of 18 places in Australia we have identified as analogous in one or more ways to the
  surface of Mars. It is hoped it will be a useful tool for researchers.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Australia is one of the best places on Earth to undertake Mars analogue research activities. There is a need to
  catalogue sites of interest in Australia (which includes the Australian Antarctic Territory) to help identify locations
  for field excursions and for a possible future fixed research station. Some advantages include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Different types of natural features closely resembling similiar features observed on Mars.</li>
  <li>Weather conditions are typically favourable (i.e. low rainfall) for simulation activities for longer during the
    year than many other analogue sites,</li>
  <li>Crews can roam over a relatively large unrestricted field of operations,</li>
  <li>Support crews have relatively ready access to modern infrastructure,</li>
  <li>The selected field of operations could be found to resemble and contain many features of the Martian terrain.</li>
</ol>

<p>Australia is a developed nation with good infrastructure (e.g. roads) and the continent has been mapped extensively
  for mineral exploration purposes. Analogue work can make an important contribution not only to Mars mission planning
  and research, but to terrestrial science in the form of paleo, geologic and contemporary flora and fauna field
  studies.</p>


<h2 id="database_purpose">Database Purpose</h2>

<p>This database is a catalogue of some Australian localities identified as analogous in one or more ways to the surface
  of Mars. It is intended to become a tool for Mars researchers and mission planners interested in making use of Mars
  analogue features in Australia.</p>

<p>The database&apos;s functions include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>provide a list of localities of interest for Mars analogue activities,</li>
  <li>provide comprehensive information for these localities, to help Mars researchers assess the value of these to
    their activities and facilitate their use for analogue research,</li>
  <li>demonstrate pro-active leadership by MSA and strengthen its scientific credentials with a view to establishing
    closer links with organisations planning Mars missions,</li>
  <li>provide a basis for locality selection for MSA field operations</li>
</ol>

<p>It is envisaged the precise scope of the database will evolve through discussions with students and professionals in
  the field, both local and international.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future Development</h2>

<p>This database will provide international and local Mars researchers with a &quot;one stop shop&quot;, initially
  providing ready access to information allowing selection of analogue sites in central Australia.</p>

<p>The database should always be considered a &quot;work in progress&quot;. We hope it will evolve over time, providing
  a better medium for entering, editing, managing and accessing a larger number of entries, more detailed data and
  additional high resolution images.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to seek donated or low cost map and aerial photo images, and if possible GIS images. Access to
  GIS software and data is highly desirable. There may also be software development to help manage the information. MSA
  is an Australian not-for-profit incorporated association organisation affiliated with the private not-for-profit US
  organisation The Mars Society. MSA welcomes donations or funding support to help cover costs of its continuing
  development. For more information, contact the society President.</p>
