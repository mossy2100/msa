<p>MarsSkin 2 was first deployed on Expedition 1. After five days of deployment, the
    MarsSkin suits have been fantastic. The first few days were very hectic as we
    integrated the datalogger into the back plate and chest panel. The chest panel needed to be jigged for the
    installation of the datalogger display and keypad. This was complicated as we tried to fit the GPS and power
    connections of the datalogger inside the chestbox too. However, this has been accomplished, and the panel looks a
    treat. The suits now have a panel which shows suit and datalogger functions, as well as various switches and
    controls for each.</p>

  The most profound differences between MarsSkin and the existing MDRS suits (apart from the navy blue colour scheme)
  are the helmets, gloves and backpacks. The MarsSkin helmets are worn on the head, so they move and provide virtually
  unrestricted vision. The MDRS suits have a fixed bubble helmet, and seeing down to the pockets and feet is very
  difficult. The MarsSkin gloves are also much more flexible and useable. Finally, the backpacks needed for the
  mechanical counter pressure suits that MarsSkin simulates are much smaller than the MDRS suit backpacks, so overall
  weight and bulk is better.</p>
<p><br />
  I am only on Phase 1 of the expedition, so there are a couple of things still to be done. Firstly, a full operations
  manual needs to be written so that the suits can be used by anyone on Ex-One once I am gone. This will include a full
  donning and doffing procedure. Also, a quantitative comparison of the MarsSkin and MDRS gloves and helmet will be
  attempted.</p>
<p><br />
  Many congratulations need to be extended to the MarsSkin crew back home for their efforts. Their work has been
  invaluable and crucial to the success of the expedition.</p>
