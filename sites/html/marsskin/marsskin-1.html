      <td>The first prototype MarsSkin analogue MCP suit (shown at left) was recently displayed at AMEC2002, at the University of Sydney on 13 July, 2002.<br />
        <br />
        This suit aims to realistically recreate the form fitting layers, movement restrictions and general appearance of a real MCP suit. It incorporates a helmet system being developed by students at the University of Sydney.<br />
        <br />
        Suit designer James Waldie explained that further development work will be undertaken on the helmet, a cooling system, dataloggers /communications devices and arm mounted control systems. Field trials will also be carried out to test the suit in different conditions before it is used in real simulation studies.<br />
        <br />
        The suit represents a significant evolution from the existing analogue suits developed by the US Mars Society for use at the Devon Island and Utah research stations.</td>

The helmet group is based at the University of Sydney <a href="http://www.eng.usyd.edu.au/" target="_blank">Faculty of Engineering</a>. As part of the Advanced Engineering Program, young engineers designed and constructed a Mars Analogue Helmet System for Project MarsSkin. A team was formed of five 1st year students and two supervisors. This system incorporated some of the latest technology in the fields of wearable computing and image recognition and will be used in EVA activities during Operation Red Centre as an integral part of MarsSkin-1. The helmet was developed under the guidance of <a href="mailto:craig@ee.usyd.edu.au">Dr Craig Jin</a> from the School of Electrical Engineering, PhD student <a href="mailto:teewoon@ee.usyd.edu.au">Teewoon Tan</a> and MSA member <a href="mailto:michael_west@student.usyd.edu.au">Michael West</a>.</td>

The Layer group is based in Perth and Melbourne.</td>
